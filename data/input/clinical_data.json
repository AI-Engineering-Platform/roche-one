      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ADL5859 in relieving pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with placebo and naproxen (similar to Aleve\u00ae). A second objective is to see whether the effect of ADL5859 differs after a single dose compared with multiple doses.",
      "detailedDescription": "This Phase 2a study was conducted in 2 parts. Part A was a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 3-way crossover phase during which participants were administered study medication in the clinical facility. Part B was a 14-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple-dose phase in which participants self-administered study medication at home."

At each time point, participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. If a scheduled pain assessment was taken within 4 hours of rescue medication, the observed pain score was replaced by the pain score obtained right before the rescue medication was taken.\n\nLS means and SE were calculated from an analysis-of-covariance model with effect for treatment and baseline \"Now\" LEPI (before dosing for Treatment Period 1 of Part A) as a covariate.
