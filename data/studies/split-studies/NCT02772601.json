(Note: Periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods\\] and withdrawal are not acceptable).\n* Further inclusion criteria apply.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patients with\n\n  * non-plaque forms of psoriasis (including guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular)\n  * current drug-induced psoriasis (including an exacerbation of psoriasis from beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or lithium)\n  * active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound trial evaluations according to investigator's judgment\n* Participation in another trial with an investigational drug or device within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is greater) prior to screening. Observational study is permitted.\n* Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the study, as assessed by the investigator\n* Major surgery performed within 12 weeks prior to screening or planned within 10 months after screening (e.g. hip replacement, aneurysma removal, stomach ligation)\n* Active systemic infections during the last 2 weeks (exception: common cold) prior to screening\n* Chronic or relevant acute infections including HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), viral hepatitis and (or) tuberculosis or evidence of tuberculosis infection as defined by a positive QuantiFERON TB (tuberculosis) test within 2 months prior to or during screening. Patients with a positive QuantiFERON TB test may participate in the study if further work up including a chest X-ray (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active tuberculosis and initiation of treatment during the conduct of this study is not needed. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then treatment according to local country guidelines must have been initiated and completed prior to study initiation.\n* Active HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) and HCV (Hepatitis C Virus), defined as:\n\n  * HBV: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive (+),HBcAb positive or detected sensitivity on the HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) qualitative test for Hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab);\n  * HCV: HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) detectable in any subject with anti-HCV antibody (HCV Ab).\n* Positive screen for drugs of abuse, alcohol or cotinine at Screening.\n* Use of known inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4, including dietary supplements or herbal products containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other known CYP inducers or inhibitors within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is greater prior to study CYP cocktail probe drug administration.\n* Use of grapefruits, Seville oranges (sour or bitter oranges), starfruit and their juices, quinine, tonic water, dietary/herbal supplements and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1/1B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) transporters within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the respective medication before CYP cocktail probe drug administration.\n* Current smokers of nicotine containing products, including those who quit smoking less than 30 days prior to CYP cocktail probe drug administration.\n* Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except appropriately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix\n* Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or within 6 weeks prior to screening\n* Further exclusion criteria apply.",
