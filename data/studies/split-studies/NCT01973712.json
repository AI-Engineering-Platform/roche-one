      "briefSummary": "A periprosthetic distal femur fracture is a fracture close to a knee implant. This type of fracture is often difficult to fix because of the close proximity of the two surgical implants which can sometimes interfere with proper bone healing. Improper healing can cause significant impairment and sometimes requires additional surgeries to correct the problem. Despite considerable interest and research put into developing techniques to repair this fracture surgeons do not know which is the best way to treat this type of fracture.\n\nOur multicentre orthopaedic study group is conducting this study to compare two standard, but different treatments for periprosthetic distal femur fractures. One treatment consists of open surgery and the placement of a plate and screws along the side of the femur. The other consists of implanting an intramedullary nail in the femur.\n\nThe goal of this study is to directly compare the two treatments to see if one treatment results in better patient outcomes than the other."
