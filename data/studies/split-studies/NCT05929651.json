Participants provided 2 blood samples, one at D01 (Visit 1) pre-vaccination and another at D31 (Visit 2) post-vaccination for the immunogenicity assessments.\n\nStudy included 2 visits at D01 (Visit 1) and at D31 (Visit 2), and 1 Telephone call (TC) for safety follow-up at D09 post-study vaccination.",
