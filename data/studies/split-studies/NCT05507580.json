      "briefSummary": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin condition that may cause a rash and itching due to inflammation of the skin. Therapies spread over the skin may not be enough to control the AD in trial participants who require systemic anti-inflammatory treatment. This study evaluates the dosing flexibility of upadacitinib in adult participants with moderate to severe AD. Adverse events and change in the disease activity will be assessed.\n\nUpadacitinib is an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe/active immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's Disease (CD), and AD. The study is comprised of a 35-day Screening Period, a 12-week double-blind period and a 12-week single-blind period. During the double-blind period, participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive upadacitinib. At 12 weeks during the single blind period, participants will be blinded to the upadacitinib dose based on their EASI response and reassigned to in 1 of 4 arms. After the last study visit, there is a 30-day follow-up visit. Approximately 454 adult participants ages 18 to 64 with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy will be enrolled at up to 160 sites worldwide.\n\nThe study is comprised of a 12-week double-blind period, followed by a 12-week single-blind period. Participants will receive upadacitinib oral tablets once daily for up to 24 weeks.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care (due to study procedures). Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."

In addition, the area of AD involvement is assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%).",

It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of participant's QoL over the prior week. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much. Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater impairment of HRQoL.",
