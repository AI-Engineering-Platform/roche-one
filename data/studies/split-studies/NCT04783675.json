      "briefSummary": "The main objective is to demonstrate, from the initial episode of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children with standard prednisolone treatment, once complete remission has occurred, that the use of Rituximab (a single intravenous infusion of 375 mg/m2) may reduce the risk of subsequent relapse during 12-month of follow-up.",
      "detailedDescription": "NS is the most frequent glomerular disease in children. Between 80% and 90% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) will relapse following an initial response to corticosteroids. Half of these children will experience frequent relapses (FRNS) or become steroid-dependent (SDNS).\n\nThe results of multiple observational studies and randomized control trials have shown that Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the cluster of differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) antigen on B cells, is safe and effective for children with FRNS/SDNS without corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. To the investigators' knowledge, Rituximab has never been investigated for the initial episode of NS with the aim to reduce the subsequent risk of relapse that is a major concern in the management of children with NS.\n\nChildren aged 1-18 years with the first episode of the SSNS will be treated with a single intravenous infusion of Rituximab 375 mg/m2. The prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day (maximum 60 mg in single or divided doses) for 6 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) as a single morning dose on alternate days for the next 6 weeks; therapy is then discontinued."
