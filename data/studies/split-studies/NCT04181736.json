      "briefSummary": "Cognitive impairments contribute significantly to psychosocial dysfunction in major depressive disorder (MDD) and respond poorly to conventional antidepressants, yet selective treatments targeted to these impairments are lacking. Our previous research identified a distinct subgroup of depression called \"cognitive biotype+\" that comprises 27% of depressed patients and is characterized by pre-treatment global cognitive impairments and dysfunction in the cognitive control neural circuit. In this study, we evaluated the medication guanfacine immediate release (GIR), an alpha 2A receptor agonist, as a novel treatment for selectively improving cognitive control circuit function, performance on cognitive testing, and clinical measures the cognitive biotype+ subgroup.",
      "detailedDescription": "The flow of procedures and study visits is as follows:\n\n1. Recruitment and screening: Participants experiencing depressive symptoms and not taking any psychiatric medications as determined by a 5 half-life wash out period will be recruited from the community, including students and employees at Stanford. Recruitment will come primarily from Facebook ads, which will use only IRB approved material. A flyer will also be physically posted on boards in public locations in order to include a variety of sources for the study.\n2. Individuals will need to participate in 3 screening visits in order to enroll in the study. During the first visit, participants will review informed consent, be administered a clinical interview, and be sent instructions for completing cognitive testing at home.\n3. If eligibility after this initial screening visit, the second visit will be a medical screen in order to ensure participants are safe to take GIR and will include standard blood tests, medical history, vitals, and a urine drug test.\n4. If the participant meets medical and cognitive criteria, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans will be undertaken at another study visit at The Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging (CNI). Using a participant's task-evoked activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and performance on objective cognitive testing, we will apply thresholds using established healthy norms to select participants within the cognitive biotype+ group.\n5. Participants will receive GIR for a period of 8 weeks sent to their place of residence from Mariner pharmacy.\n6. Participants will be seen in-person or virtually by a study clinician at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and an appropriately trained clinical research coordinator at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. All subjects will have an fMRI scan after 6-8 weeks of taking GIR. During in-person visits and virtual monitoring, we will assess participants for the following: changes to symptoms, function, and suicidality, adherence to GIR, changes to concomitant medication(s), adverse events (AEs), birth control usage compliance, likelihood of pregnancy (female participants of childbearing potential), and vital signs if appropriate.\n7. If participants wish to continue GIR and their psychiatrist or PCP is willing to prescribe this, they will continue with their current dose for weeks 9 and 10. If they prefer to stop taking GIR and/or they do not have a provider who is willing to continue GIR, the participant will be tapered off the medication."

Task-evoked activation and connectivity are expressed as Z-scores, which represent the number of standard deviations the observed value is from the mean of a healthy reference dataset (population mean = 0). There is no fixed minimum or maximum for Z-scores. Standard deviations above the mean (a positive Z-score) indicate that the observed activation or connectivity is higher than the mean of the healthy reference dataset, while standard deviations below the mean (a negative Z-score) indicate it is lower. A negative Z-score indicates a worse outcome. For this study, a Z-score of \\<= -0.5 indicates poor cognitive control.",

Task-evoked activation and connectivity are expressed as Z-scores, which represent the number of standard deviations the observed value is from the mean of a healthy reference dataset (population mean = 0). There is no fixed minimum or maximum for Z-scores. Standard deviations above the mean (a positive Z-score) indicate that the observed activation or connectivity is higher than the mean of the healthy reference dataset, while standard deviations below the mean (a negative Z-score) indicate it is lower. A negative Z-score indicates a worse outcome. For this study, a Z-score of \\<= -0.5 indicates poor cognitive control.",

Test performance is expressed as a composite Z-score, representing deviations from the mean of a healthy reference dataset (population mean = 0). Composite Z-scores were calculated by averaging: Maze (trials completed, completion and path learning time, errors), Digit Span (recall span, correct trials), Verbal Interference (total errors, reaction time), and Switching of Attention (completion time, connection time, errors). For GoNoGo, only reaction times were used as data was collected in-scanner, and data for this measure was normalized to the group. Extreme scores were winsorized to a threshold of 5 standard deviations. Z-scores have no fixed range; positive scores indicate better performance, negative scores indicate worse performance.
