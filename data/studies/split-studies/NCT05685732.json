      "briefSummary": "This is a multicenter, dose-optimized, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, efficacy and safety study with Azstarys® in children 4 to 12 years of age with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Azstarys® contains dexmethylphenidate (d-MPH) and serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), a prodrug of d-MPH and is orally administered. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of Azstarys® compared to placebo in treating children ages 4 to 12 years old with ADHD. The study will consist of two randomized and blinded treatment cohorts ages 4 to 5 years of age and 6 to 12 years of age. Randomization will be applied separately with a starting dose up-titration at different dose levels for each cohort. 130 and 100 subjects will be enrolled, respectively. Approximately 20 sites will participate.",
      "detailedDescription": "* Screening Period (Visit 1) Subjects will undergo a screening period up to 30 days prior to entering the Treatment Period.\n* Double-Blind Treatment Period (Visit 2 through Visit 6, approx. 28 days) Eligible subjects will be randomized in a blinded fashion to Azstarys® or placebo at the start of the Treatment Period. Randomization will be applied separately in each cohort and stratified by gender.\n\n  * Cohort 1: Subjects 4 and 5 years (\\<6 years) will start at 13.1 mg/2.6 mg or matching placebo and may be titrated up or down to doses of 13.1 mg/2.6 mg, 26.1 mg/5.2 mg, or 39.2 mg/7.8 mg Azstarys® or matching placebo approximately each week through Visit 5 (Day 21)\n  * Cohort 2: Subjects 6-12 years (\\<13 years) will start at 39.2 mg/7.8 mg or matching placebo and may be titrated up or down to doses of 26.1 mg/5.2 mg, 39.2 mg/7.8 mg, or 52.3 mg/10.4 mg Azstarys® or matching placebo approximately each week through Visit 5 (Day 21) Subjects who participate in Cohort 1 and successfully complete the Treatment Period will have the option to participate in a 12-month open-label safety study with Azstarys®."

Subject has generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder that has been the primary focus of treatment at any time during the 12 months prior to Screening or that has required pharmacotherapy any time during the 6 months prior to Screening.\n5. Subject has evidence of any chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) such as tumors, inflammation, seizure disorder, depression, vascular disorder, potential CNS-related disorders that might occur in childhood (e.g., Duchenne Muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, or other neurologic or serious neuromuscular disorders), or history of persistent neurological symptoms attributable to serious head injury.\n6. Subject taking anticonvulsants for seizure control or antidepressants currently or within the past 2 years before Screening are not eligible for study participation. A past history of febrile seizure or drug-induced seizure is allowed.\n7. Subject has a current (last month) psychiatric diagnosis other than specific phobia, motor skills disorders, ODD, sleep disorders, elimination disorders, adjustment disorders, learning disorders, or communication disorders. Subjects allowed to enroll with any of these DSM disorders will require written justification from the Investigator documenting why the conditions will not interfere with participation and to emphasize that ADHD is the primary indication.\n8. In the opinion of the Investigator, subject has clinically significant suicidal ideation/behavior, based on history of attempted suicide and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) assessment at Screening.\n9. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease (including asthma or diabetes), or a history of a clinically significant abnormality of the cardiovascular (including cardiomyopathy, serious arrhythmias, structural cardiac disorders, or severe hypertension), gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatic, or renal systems, or a disorder or history of a condition (e.g., malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the medical monitor should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if controlled) must be discussed with the Medical Monitor during Screening.\n10. Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECGs, which in the Investigator's opinion is clinically significant.\n11. Subject has a history of, or currently has, a malignancy.\n12. Subject has uncontrolled thyroid disorder as evidenced by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) ≤0.8 x the lower limit of normal (LLN) or ≥1.25 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference laboratory at Screening.\n13. Subject has greater than trace proteinuria in the urinalysis at Screening. Subjects with greater than trace proteinuria in the urinalysis at Screening but with a urine protein to creatinine (UP/C) ratio \\<0.2 in a first morning void urine sample will not be excluded from enrollment.\n14. Subjects has a current or recent (past 12 months) history of drug abuse; or current or recent history of drug abuse in someone living in the subject's home, or are using or planning to use prohibited drugs during the trial as specified in the protocol.\n15. Subject has a positive urine drug screen at Screening. Subjects with a positive methylphenidate (MPH) urine drug screen may be allowed to continue in the study, provided that the Investigator determines that the positive test is a result of taking prescribed medications and subject is willing to wash out the current medication as required.\n16. Subject has participated in any other clinical study with an investigational drug/product within 30 days or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to Screening.\n17. Subject has taken ADHD medications from more than one class within 30 days prior to Screening. Subjects on a stable dose of one ADHD medication with occasional use of ADHD medications from another class are eligible at the discretion of the Investigator.\n18. Subjects with demonstrated lack of response or intolerability to adequate dose and duration of treatment with MPH products.

Subject has a history of severe allergies or adverse drug reactions to more than one class of medications.\n22. Subject has a history of allergic reaction or a known or suspected sensitivity to MPH or any substance that is contained in the study drug.\n23. Subject, parent/legal guardian, and caregiver (if applicable, at the Investigator's discretion) has commitments during the study that would interfere with attending study visits.\n24. Subject or subject's family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of the investigative site during the study period, or plans extended travel inconsistent with the recommended visit interval during study duration.\n25. Subject has one or more siblings living in the same household who are enrolled in this or another clinical drug trial.\n26. Subject shows evidence of current physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.\n27. Subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable in any other way to participate in this study.",
