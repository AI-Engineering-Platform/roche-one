      "briefSummary": "The MORDOR trial found that biannual distribution of azithromycin to children 1-59 months old reduced child mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) released conditional guidelines for this intervention, which include targeting azithromycin distributions to children 1-11 months of age in high mortality settings.Targeting treatment to children 1-11 months old could reduce antimicrobial resistance by limiting antibiotic distributions while treating children at the highest mortality risk. However, this targeted intervention has not yet been tested.\n\nThe AVENIR mortality/resistance trial aims to assess the efficacy of age-based targeting of biannual azithromycin distribution on mortality as well as determine the impact of age-based targeting on antimicrobial resistance.",
      "detailedDescription": "In the Mortality/Resistance trial, 3,000 communities in the Dosso and Tahoua regions of Niger will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) azithro 1-11: biannual oral azithromycin to children 1-11 months old with biannual oral placebo to children 12-59 months old, 2) azithro 1-59: biannual oral azithromycin to children 1-59 months old, or 3) placebo: biannual oral placebo to children 1-59 months old. Interventions will be delivered biannually through a door-to-door census. Mortality will also be monitored through biannual census data collection, which will be used to adaptively allocate treatment assignments after the first year. Communities will retain an allocation for 4 distributions before being re-randomized.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance will be monitored using cluster sampling of treated and untreated children and adults in the Dosso region.\n\nTo compare costs, coverage, and acceptability of treating 1-11-month-old children only vs children 1-59 months old, an additional 80 communities in the Dosso region will be selected. These communities will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either receive 1) distribution of open-label azithromycin to children 1-11 months old with no intervention to children 12-59 months old or 2) distribution of open-label azithromycin to children 1-59 months old. The primary outcome for this substudy will be community-level costs per dose delivered. Secondary outcomes include program costs, treatment coverage, and acceptability of the intervention according to community leaders, community health workers, and caregivers of eligible children."
