      "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether insulin glargine reduces the risk of serious hypoglycemia or improves Time in Range at 6 months when compared against standard of care human insulin (e.g. NPH or premixed 70/30) among youth living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in low resource settings.",
      "detailedDescription": "Long-acting insulin analogues have become a de-facto standard of care for patients with T1D living in high-income countries. Unfortunately, insulin analogues remain unavailable or unaffordable for much of the global population. In both 2017 and 2019, applications to add long-acting insulin analogues to the WHO's Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) were rejected due to insufficient evidence of superiority and an unfavorable cost-effectiveness profile when compared against older, less expensive, human insulins (e.g., NPH insulin and premixed 70/30 insulin). In 2021, long-acting insulin analogues were added to the EML but the decision remains controversial since the WHO concluded that \"magnitude of clinical benefit of long-acting insulin analogues over human insulin for most clinical outcomes was small.\" Moreover, studies that compare long-acting insulin analogues versus human insulins conducted in high-income settings may not generalize to children and young adults living with T1D in very low-resource settings.\n\nTo address this unmet need, Pitt has partnered with Brigham and Women's Hospital, The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Clinton Health Access Initiative and Life For a Child to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing insulin glargine, a long-acting analogue insulin, against intermediate human insulin among 400 children and young adults living with T1D in a lower resource setting.\n\nNote: In preparation for results submission, we made minor changes to the outcomes sections to reflect what is listed in the protocol.\n\nFor Primary Outcomes #1 and #2, and Secondary Outcomes #3,#4, #5, #7, #8: we added 12 months measurements (in addition to the 6 months measurement). We updated Secondary Outcome #9 to specify the PedsQL Diabetes Symptoms Score. We added Secondary Outcome #10 to include the PedsQL Diabetes Management Score. We added Secondary Outcome #11 for ITSQ scores."
