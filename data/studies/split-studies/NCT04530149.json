      "briefSummary": "I. Background:\n\nPatients with multiple rib fractures are challenging from both pulmonary and analgesia perspectives. Adequate pain management is essential in prevention of complications secondary to decreased inspiratory volume. Significant morbidity and mortality of rib fractures is secondary to severe pain that limits ribcage movement, decreases inspiratory volumes and causes inadequate cough. Decreased vital capacity predisposes patients to atelectasis, abnormal mucous clearance and pneumonia. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) in improvement of vital capacity in patients with multiple unilateral rib fractures when compared to conventional management with medications. Currently, evidence of efficacy of SAPB in managing pain secondary to multiple rib fractures is limited to case reports and series, none of which evaluate vital capacity.\n\nII. Significance:\n\nThe findings of this study may indicate that SAPB is superior to pharmacological management in increasing vital capacity in patients with multiple unilateral rib fractures and suggest SAPB for first line therapy in patients with rib fractures. The findings may decrease the risk of pulmonary complications as well as the use of opiates in management of multiple rib fractures in the Emergency Department especially in patients with numerous comorbidities and contraindications to conventional treatment modalities. This study may support the need for training emergency medicine physicians in bedside SAPB in order to provide the optimal therapy for patient with multiple unilateral rib fractures.\n\nIII. Study Objectives:\n\nThe primary objectives are to evaluate whether ultrasound guided SAPB results in a greater improvement in percent predicted vital capacity compared to standard therapy with a sham injection. The investigators will also evaluate pain scores and the safety profile of the SAPB procedure compared to those receiving standard analgesia.\n\nIV. Hypothesis:\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that SAPB is superior to sham injection in improving the percent of predicted vital capacity. The secondary hypothesis is that SAPB will have greater improvement in pain scores and have a superior safety profile compared to placebo injection.",
      "detailedDescription": "STUDY DESIGN\n\nThis is a single center prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial with a convenience sample that will be conducted in the Emergency Department of an urban level I trauma center.\n\nA. Identify and enroll all patients coming in to the ED patient with presumed or clinically apparent 2 or more unilateral rib fractures between T3 to T9, with a resting pain score of ≥5. All patients meeting exclusion criteria will be excluded.\n\nB. Randomization procedure:\n\n1. Pharmacy will dispense 30mL of injectate which will be randomized in block of 10 to either the SAPB group (30mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine) or sham group (30mL of normal saline).\n\nC. Injection\n\n1. Patient consent will be obtained and time out will be performed on all patients.\n2. Patients will be placed on cardiac monitor and placed in lateral decubitus or if unable to turn, they will be supine.\n3. Under the usual sterile technique, the serratus anterior muscle overlying the 5th rib at the mid-axillary line will be identified with ultrasound.\n4. A spinal needle will be introduced in-plane under ultrasound guidance and advanced until the needle tip is located in the fascial plane just above the serratus anterior muscle. The needle tip will not be advanced unless completely visualized under ultrasound.\n5. Normal saline will be injected first to determine correct location of the needle tip. Spreading of fluid along the fascial plane will confirm the correct location of the needle tip.\n6. The normal saline will then be switched to the study drug of which 30mL of either normal saline or 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine which will then be injected into the fascial plane as described in Blanco et al, and Hetta et al.\n7. The study drug will be injected 5mL at a time and the patient will be asked if any symptoms of Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST toxicity) are present (perioral numbness, tinnitus, dizziness).\n8. After injection is completed the needle will be withdrawn and patient will remain on the cardiac monitor for another 30 minutes to monitor for symptoms of LAST toxicity (Di Gregorio).\n9. This procedure was based on the serratus anterior plane block protocol from Khalil et al.\n\nD. Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) Measurement\n\n1. SVC will be performed using spirometer that has been internally validated\n2. SVC will be performed by physicians trained by the respiratory therapy department and who have demonstrated validation compared to respiratory therapist obtained SVC values\n3. The patient will be sitting up when performing SVC and a script will be followed as to how to educate and coach the patient on performing appropriate incentive spirometry technique.\n4. At least 3 SVC measurements within 150mL of each other are required to qualify for an accurate measurement.\n5. The maximum of these 3 SVC values and a corresponding % predicted SVC will be obtained and considered the maximum % predicted SVC.\n6. % Predicted SVC will be obtained based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) calculator through the CDC.\n\nE. Pain scores\n\n1. Subjects will be asked to rate their maximum pain score from 0-10 with resting breathing and with deep breaths.\n\nDesign:\n\nA. Potential study patients will be identified through review of the emergency department (ED) electronic board, and ED physicians will also screen for potential study patients. Pain scores are assessed in triage as is standard in the ED.\n\nB. If the patient has pain from presumed or clinically apparent 2 or more unilateral rib fractures between T3 to T9, and he/she has a resting pain score of ≥5 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, where 0 is no pain, 5 is moderate pain, and 10 is the worst possible pain upon initial assessment, then he/she will be eligible to participate in the study.\n\nThe patient will then be asked to participate if he/she does not have any exclusion criteria.\n\nC. At time of enrollment, the patient will have recorded pain scores, vital signs, and slow vital capacity measured.\n\nD. All patients will then receive as their initial analgesic oral acetaminophen 975 mg followed by morphine sulfate 0.05 mg/kg IV rounded to the nearest milligram.\n\nE. Each patient will then be randomized in either of two arms:\n\n1. Ultrasound guided serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) with 30mL 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine.\n2. Ultrasound guided serratus anterior plane injection with placebo injection with 30mL of normal saline.\n\n6\\. Investigators will be blinded to the arm that the patient has been randomized to, as the randomization will occur through the pharmacy dispensing the medication.\n\n7\\. Using an online randomizer in blocks of 10, the pharmacy will dispense either 30mL of normal saline for the sham group, or 30mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine for the nerve block group.\n\n8\\. All patients will receive either SAPB or placebo injection within an hour of receiving the initial analgesics of acetaminophen and morphine.\n\n9\\. If the patient still has a pain score ≥5 thirty minutes after the injection, the treating physician will be informed and the patient will be medicated at the treating physician's discretion.\n\n10\\. The patient will be followed up with up to 24 hours throughout their hospital stay.\n\nData Collection Procedures:\n\nA. Demographics 1. Age, sex, ethnicity, height B. Past medical history 1.
