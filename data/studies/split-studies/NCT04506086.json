          "description": "The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses the health related quality of life of cancer patients participating in clinical trials. The EORTC QLQ-C30 forms a global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) scale, 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), and 9 symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). All of the scales/items measures get mapped to a common range from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus, a negative change for the global health status/QoL scale represents a lower QoL, a negative change for a functional scale represents a lower level of functioning, a positive change for a symptom scale/item represents a higher level of symptomatology/problems.",
