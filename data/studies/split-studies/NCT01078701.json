      "detailedDescription": "GHB11L1 intends to provide a novel vaccination for influenza virus infection. 48 healthy volunteers will be included in this phase IIa study investigating three dose levels. 16 subjects will be randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for GHB11L1 or placebo.\n\nHealthy male volunteers, 18-50 years of age and seronegative with respect to the applied virus antigens (antibody titers \\<1:10 detected) will be randomised.\n\nGHB11L1 will be administered once on day 1. Follow-up visits will be performed on days 2, 8 and 29."
