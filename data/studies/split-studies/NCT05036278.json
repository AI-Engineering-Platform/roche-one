      "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder that is caused by the lack of a protein in the blood called \"clotting factor 8\" (FVIII). FVIII is naturally found in the blood where it causes the blood to clump together to help prevent and stop bleeding. People with lower levels of FVIII or with FVIII that does not work properly may bleed for a long time from minor wounds, have painful bleeding into joints, or have internal bleeding.\n\nThe study treatment, Jivi (also called damoctocog alfa pegol), is already available for doctors to prescribe to people with hemophilia A to treat and prevent bleeding. It works by replacing the missing FVIII, or the FVIII that does not work properly.\n\nPeople with hemophilia A need frequent injections of FVIII products into the vein. So called standard half-life (SHL) products need to be given 2 to 4 times a week for the prevention of bleeding. In recent years, new products like Jivi called extended half-life (EHL) products have become available. These products last longer in the body so that they require to be given less often with injections every 3-5 days. Thus, these treatments may be easier and more comfortable to stick to in daily life. There is no general plan concerning the best amount of treatment and the frequency of injections for the prevention of bleeding, since the severity may be different and individual risk factors have to be considered. Doctors often decide on a treatment plan based on their experience.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well a new scoring approach works to select a treatment plan for the prevention of bleeding in people with hemophilia A who switch their treatment from SHL products to Jivi. Different types of information are used to calculate the risk score like bleeding history, certain biological factors, and physical activity of the participant.\n\nAll participants will receive Jivi for 6 months.\n\nIn the first four weeks, all participants will receive Jivi 2 times a week at a dose level of 40 IU per kilogram body weight (also known as 40 IU/kg/dose, recommended maximum dose is 6,000 IU). Then, based on their risk score, each participant will be assigned to one of three treatment plans:\n\n* participants with a high risk remain on Jivi administration 2 times a week at 40 IU/kg/dose\n* participants with a medium risk will switch to Jivi administration every 5 days at 50 IU/kg/dose\n* participants with a low risk will switch to Jivi administration every 5 days at 50 IU/kg/dose and after 4 weeks to a less frequent administration (e.g., every 7 days) at 60 IU/kg/dose To check how well the new scoring approach works for choosing the right treatment plan, researchers will look at how many participants have a favourable outcome.\n\nThis means that the participant has either fewer bleeding events vs. the pre-study treatment and takes Jivi less often or as often as the previous SHL treatment but with fewer bleeding events, or that the participant has a comparable number of bleeding events but needs to take Jivi less often than the previous treatment. Each participant will be in the study for approximately 7.5 months. During this time, 4 visits to the study site and 3 phone calls are planned. During the study, the doctors and their study team will: • do physical examinations • take blood samples • ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having. In addition, participants or their guardians are required to write down the dates of Jivi treatments and bleeding events in an electronic diary and to fill in different questionnaires on their quality of life, health status, work/ school productivity, pain, and treatment satisfaction. In addition, participants are expected to keep appointments for visits and to adhere to the assigned treatment regimen.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments."

As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.\n\nInterested researchers can use www.vivli.org to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research. Information on the Bayer criteria for listing studies and other relevant information is provided in the member section of the portal."
