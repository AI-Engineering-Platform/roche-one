      "briefSummary": "Obstetrical hemorrhage (excessive bleeding related to pregnancy) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity (disease or symptom of disease) and mortality (death) worldwide with a significantly higher frequency and severity following cesarean delivery. Twin gestations (twin pregnancy) are at particularly higher risk for postpartum hemorrhage, yet the management of obstetrical bleeding following twin delivery remains identical to singleton delivery.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to understand the effect of prophylactic methylergonovine on blood loss in scheduled twin pregnancy cesarean deliveries. Participants will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to Methylergonovine (investigational drug) or water with salt (saline) (placebo). Methylergonovine or saline will be given as an injection immediately after delivery.",
      "detailedDescription": "Obstetrical hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide with a significantly higher frequency and severity following cesarean delivery. In 2020, 31.9 percent of pregnant women in the United States underwent cesarean delivery, making it the second most common operation performed. Though multiple complications can occur following cesarean delivery, hemorrhage morbidities are among the most common with significant cardiovascular implications. Twin gestations are at particularly higher risk for postpartum hemorrhage due to impaired myometrial contractility and atony following overdistention; increased maternal blood volume; and increased uterine blood flow compared to singletons, yet the management of obstetrical bleeding following twin delivery remains identical to singleton delivery. Current strategies to address intrapartum hemorrhage have relied on pharmacological and mechanical treatments after intraoperative identification. However, there is extensive work on prophylactic therapies administered intraoperatively to prevent obstetrical hemorrhage. Recent evidence has emerged about the utility of prophylactic Methylergonovine for the prevention of obstetrical hemorrhage. Methylergonovine, a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid, acts primarily on alpha adrenergic receptors of uterine and vascular smooth muscle, increasing uterine tone and promoting vasoconstriction. In a randomized trial of 80 women undergoing intrapartum cesarean delivery found that fewer patients who were allocated to the methylergonovine group received additional uterotonic agents (20% vs 55%, relative risk (RR) 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.6). Participants receiving methylergonovine were more likely to have satisfactory uterine tone (80% vs 41%, RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.6), lower incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (35% vs 59%, RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9), lower mean quantitative blood loss (967 mL vs 1,315 mL; mean difference 348, 95% CI 124-572), and a lower frequency of blood transfusion (5% vs 23%, RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Investigators concluded that the administration of prophylactic methylergonovine in addition to oxytocin in patients undergoing intrapartum cesarean birth reduces the need for additional uterotonic agents. In a prospective study of 1210 participants found that intraoperative, prophylactic methylergonovine decreased post-operative blood loss with no adverse side effects. Randomized trials of Methylergonovine as prophylaxis to prevent hemorrhage in cesarean delivery have exclude twin gestations. Currently, there remains a paucity of research regarding prophylactic procedures for twin cesarean delivery. There is an opportunity to prophylactically address hemorrhage in high-risk groups. Therefore, the investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial which will compare maternal blood loss associated with prophylactic methylergonovine during cesarean delivery among patients with twin."
