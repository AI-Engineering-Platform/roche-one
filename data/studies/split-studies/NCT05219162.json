      "briefSummary": "Although some small sample studies have reported the possible resistance mechanisms of Osimertinib in the first-line treatment, it is still an urgent need to explore the whole gene profile in EGFRm advanced NSCLC patients post Osimertinib 1L treatment by paired tissue and plasma to guide subsequent treatment strategy. Thus, the gene profile post Osimertinib 1L treatment in tissue and plasma may help to guide the following treatment.\n\nParticipants will be required to provide paired tissue and whole blood after disease progression following 1L Osimertinib. 200 tissue samples and 200 whole blood samples will be used to detect gene alteration by NGS, respectively. 200 tissue samples will be used to detect pathological transformation by IHC. Approximately 80-100 tissue samples will be used to test MET overexpression by MET IHC and MET amplification by FISH respectively. Approximately 80-100 whole blood samples will be used to test MET amplification by ddPCR.",

As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, which in the investigator's opinion, makes it undesirable for the participant to participate in the study or that would jeopardise compliance with the protocol,. Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\n\n   Prior/Concomitant Therapy\n3. Any concurrent anticancer treatment except local radiotherapy and radiotherapy for CNS metastasis. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non cancer related conditions (eg, hormone replacement therapy) is allowed.\n\nPrior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience 5 Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\n\nOther Exclusions 6 Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\n\n7 In addition, the following are considered criteria for exclusion from the exploratory genetic research:\n\n* Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant\n* Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of genetic sample collection.",
