      "briefSummary": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder. Crizanlizumab is indicated to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in patients with SCD aged 16 years and older.\n\nThe purpose of this local Phase IV study was to evaluate the safety of crizanlizumab specifically in Indian patients with SCD aged 16 years or older with a history of VOC leading to healthcare visit.",
      "detailedDescription": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder, caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, which early on progresses into a systemic disease. Vaso-occlusion is a hallmark of SCD and can lead to serious acute and chronic complications.\n\nThe purpose of this local Phase IV study was to evaluate the safety of crizanlizumab specifically in Indian patients with SCD aged 16 years or older with a history of VOC leading to healthcare visit.\n\nThe study was open label and single armed. 140 patients were treated with crizanlizumab for approximately one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg in addition to receiving standard of care.\n\nThe primary objective was to assess frequency, severity and causality of serious adverse events (SAEs) during the treatment period. Secondary objective was to assess overall safety and tolerability of crizanlizumab."
