      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different brolucizumab 6 mg dosing regimens in patients with visual impairment due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who have previously received anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study was a 52-week randomized, open-label, multi-center, two-arm study for pretreated patients with suboptimal anatomically controlled nAMD. Patients who consented were screened to evaluate eligibility. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms:\n\n* Brolucizumab 6 mg \"loading arm\": 1 loading injection every 4 weeks for 3 consecutive injections (baseline, weeks 4 and 8) followed by an injection every 12 weeks.\n* Brolucizumab 6 mg \"non-loading arm\": one initial injection followed by an injection every 12 weeks\n\nThere were three periods in this study:\n\n* Screening period: from day -14 to baseline\n* Open-label treatment period: from baseline (day 1) to week 48\n* Post-treatment follow-up period: from week 48 to week 52\n\nIn both study arms, treatment intervals after the initiation phase were either 8 weeks or 12 weeks depending on disease activity status. More frequent injections, i.e., treatment intervals of \\< 8 weeks were not allowed after the initiation phase."
