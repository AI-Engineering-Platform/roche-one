Each of the 5 dimensions were divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (level 1 = no problem, level 2 = slight problems, level 3 = moderate problems, level 4 = severe problems, level 5 = extreme problems). The participant selected an answer for each of the 5 dimensions considering a response that best matched participant's health \"today.\" Responses were used to generate health status index ranged from -0.594 to 1 (where 1 represents full health and negative values represent health states considered worse than dead).
