HS-FOCUS includes 2 validated components: a parent version and a participant self-reported version for those over age 12 years. The HS-FOCUS (shortened version) questionnaire has 5 function domains (walking/standing, grip/reach, school/work, activities, and breathing). Items are scored using a response scale from 0 to 3, with 0 signifying an ability to complete the activity-related functions 'without any difficulty' and 3 denoting highest disability. Higher scores on each domain indicate greater disability.",

It is a 30-item instrument that measures functional capacity and independence in activities of daily life across eight domains: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and activities. For each domain, there is a 4-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 to 3, with 0 corresponding to 'without any difficulty' and 3 to 'unable to do'. Higher scores on each domain indicate greater disability.",
