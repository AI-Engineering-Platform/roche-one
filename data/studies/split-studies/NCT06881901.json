      "briefSummary": "To evaluate the long-term outcomes of different antiplatelet strategies, including DAPT, aspirin monotherapy, and clopidogrel monotherapy, in CCS patients undergoing CABG. A retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (K-NHIS) database.",
      "detailedDescription": "The use of antiplatelet agents is crucial in preventing atherothrombotic complications and maintaining graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). While dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is recommended for one year in patients undergoing CABG for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the optimal antiplatelet strategy for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) remains unclear. In fact, current guidelines show discrepancies, with the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) recommending DAPT for one year to reduce the risk of saphenous vein graft (SVG) occlusion (Class IIb), while the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends switching to aspirin monotherapy to reduce bleeding risk and considers DAPT only for high-risk patients (Class IIb). However, aspirin monotherapy may also not be the optimal alternative due to its limited efficacy in preventing thrombotic events and its inability to significantly reduce major bleeding compared to DAPT. Recently, clopidogrel monotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative, potentially offering both ischemic protection and a lower bleeding risk compared to DAPT even compared to aspirin monotherapy. An observational study comparing clopidogrel monotherapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin after CABG found that clopidogrel monotherapy demonstrated comparable to the combination therapy group. While this suggests that clopidogrel monotherapy could be a viable alternative, previous study was limited by its short follow-up duration and lack of bleeding outcome assessment. Thus, the investigators performed target trial emulation to evaluate long-term ischemic and bleeding outcomes associated with DAPT, aspirin monotherapy, and clopidogrel monotherapy in CCS patients following CABG."
