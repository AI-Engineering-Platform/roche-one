      "briefSummary": "Improvement in bleeding and bruising has been described by using both intravenous and topical off-label applications of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in many surgical fields. This trial tests how well applying tranexamic acid (TXA) to the surface of the surgical site (topically) works to reduce post-operative bleeding (hematomas) and fluid collections (seromas) in women undergoing surgery to remove both breasts (bilateral mastectomy) immediately followed by surgery to rebuild the breast (reconstruction). The formation of hematomas and seromas, a common post-mastectomy complication, can interfere with breast reconstruction and increase the risk of infection and wound healing and can potentially delay cancer treatments. TXA is a synthetic molecule that pushes the body's clotting cascade toward clot formation to improve blood clotting. Applying TXA topically to the surgical site before closing the incision may prevent hematoma and seroma formation in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction patients.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from patients undergoing bilateral mastectomy at University of California, San Francisco.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OUTCOMES:\n\nI. To investigate whether topical tranexamic acid may impact rates of seroma, hematoma, severe bruising, and drain output in the post-mastectomy reconstructive population.\n\nII. To evaluate the impact of TXA on seroma rates compared to control.\n\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of TXA on patient and provider rating of bruising, comparing the TXA side to the control side.\n\nII. To evaluate the impact of TXA on total drain output in the first post operative day.\n\nIII. To evaluate the impact of TXA on total drain duration.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will only be treated intra-operatively at the time of surgery with topical TXA to one breast pocket. Each participant will serve as own internal control, with one side receiving saline and the other TXA. Participants in this study will be assessed at their regularly scheduled visits up to one year post-operatively."
