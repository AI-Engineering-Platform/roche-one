The purpose of this study is to compare NT-proBNP levels at the 4-6 week postpartum visit between groups. There is currently no data on the maternal health effects associated with continuation of low-dose aspirin in the postpartum period. This study aims to fill a gap in the knowledge regarding the utility of low-dose aspirin following delivery."
