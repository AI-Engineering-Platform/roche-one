The investigators will recruit 28 Latina women at-risk of HBOC (14 randomized at each arm) at three sites with sizable Latinx populations. The sites include community clinics/health organizations and hospitals with whom we have established collaborations \\[Georgetown University (DC); Virginia Commonwealth University (VA)\\].\n\nResults will improve efforts to translate genomic guidelines into practice and will reduce disparities by evaluating a low cost highly disseminable culturally-targeted video while gathering data on effectiveness and implementation.\n\nAim 1. Evaluate the impact of video vs. FORCE fact sheet on GCRA and testing uptake and psychosocial outcomes.\n\nAim 2. Assess implementation potential and needs by evaluating feasibility, acceptability, reach, and adoption of the intervention arms (video and FORCE fact sheet) and of the HBOC screening process at the community clinics."

Rosa Visits a Genetic Counselor.\" With R03 funding (R03CA191543) we developed a culturally targeted narrative video for at-risk Latinas. A multidisciplinary team of researchers collaborated with filmmakers to develop the script and video. The script was informed by health behavior conceptual models, evidence-based risk communication strategies, and formative research (40 interviews with providers and at-risk Latinas). The script addressed identified knowledge gaps (e.g., incorrect belief that pap smears screen for ovarian cancer), facilitators (e.g., inform family cancer risk), barriers (e.g., emotional concerns), and cultural factors (e.g., respect). The 18-minute video illustrates the GCRA process with the story of Rosa, a Latina cancer survivor at increased risk of HBOC. Rosa learns about HBOC risk factors, overcomes barriers, and attends genetic counseling.",
