This open-label, treatment study will examine the efficacy of Azstarys on ADHD symptoms using the AISRS 18-item total score on the AISRS-expanded; the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale. The investigators will also examine Executive Function later in the day (early evening, about 12 hours after first morning dosing)."
