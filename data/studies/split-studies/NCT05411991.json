      "detailedDescription": "Key interventions are:\n\n* Assessment of UNa in spot urine samples after every bolus administration of loop diuretics with continuation of intravenous diuretics until resolution of clinical signs of fluid overload AND UNa \\<80 mmol/L\n* Dosing of loop diuretic bolus according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\n* Upfront use of intravenous acetazolamide 500 mg OD unless hypernatremia (\\>145 mmol/L) or metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate \\<22 mmol/L)\n* Upfront use of oral chlorthalidone 50 mg OD if eGFR \\<30 mL/min/1.73m² OR hypernatremia (\\>145 mmol/L)\n* Switch to full nephron blockade with intravenous acetazolamide 500 mg OD, intravenous bumetanide 4 mg TID, oral chlorthalidone 100 mg OD, and intravenous canrenoate 200 mg OD in case of diuretic resistance, defined as UNa \\<80 mmol/L and persistent clinical signs of fluid overload\n* Provision of 500 mL intravenous Dextrose 5% with 3 g MgSO4 and 40 mmol KCl daily during diuretic therapy with intravenous diuretics"

In a pair of subjects, both surviving up till day 30, the subject with the highest number of days alive and out of hospital or care facility during the 30-day follow-up window is declared the winner.\n3. In a pair of subjects, both surviving up till day 30 with the same number of days alive and out of hospital/care facility, the subject with the greatest relative reduction in NTproBNP from baseline is the winner (rounded to the closest percentage with a minimal difference of 5%).
