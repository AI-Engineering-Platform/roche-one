Have filled-in self-rating diary in accordance with the diary instructions and with ≤ 3 missing entries per day, in the 3 days preceding V2a/V2b.\n13. With at least 1.5 OFF hours per day, excluding the early morning pre-first dose OFF period (i.e. the time between wake-up and response to the first L dopa/DDCI dosage), as recorded in at least 2 of the 3 days in the self-rating diary for the 3 days preceding V2a/V2b.\n14. Results of the screening laboratory tests are considered acceptable by the investigator (i.e. not clinically relevant for the well-being of the patient or for the purpose of the study).\n15. Domain 3 of KPPS ≥ 12.\n16. Adequate compliance to relevant (PD and pain related) concomitant medication during the screening period (based on the investigator's judgment).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Non-idiopathic PD (atypical parkinsonism, secondary \\[acquired or symptomatic\\] parkinsonism, Parkinson-plus syndrome).\n2. Severe and/or unpredictable OFF periods, according to investigator judgement.\n3. Major/prominent non-PD-related pain (e.g. due to malignant disease).\n4. Treatment with prohibited medication: entacapone, tolcapone, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (except selegiline up to 10 mg/day in oral formulation or 1.25 mg/day in buccal absorption formulation, rasagiline up to 1 mg/day or safinamide up to 100 mg/day), or antiemetics with antidopaminergic action (except domperidone) within the last 4 weeks before V1.\n5. Previous or planned (during the entire study duration) L-dopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion, deep brain stimulation or stereotactic surgery (e.g. pallidotomy, thalamotomy).\n6. Treatment with apomorphine within the last 4 weeks before V1 or likely to be needed at any time until V6.\n7. Previous or current use of opicapone.\n8. Use of any other IP, currently or within the 3 months (or within 5 half-lives of the IP, whichever is longer) before V1.\n9. Past (within the past year) or present history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.\n10. Current or previous (within the past year) alcohol or substance abuse excluding caffeine or nicotine.\n11. Phaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or other catecholamine secreting neoplasms.\n12. Known hypersensitivity to the excipients of IP (including lactose intolerance, galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption) or of rescue medication.\n13. History of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis.\n14. History of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n15. Previous history of psychosis or psychiatric disorders, including severe major depression.\n16. Any medical condition that might place the patient at increased risk or interfere with assessments.\n17. For females: Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n18. Employees of the investigator, study centre, sponsor, clinical research organisation and study consultants, when employees are directly involved in this study or other studies under the direction of this investigator or study centre, and their family members.\n19.
