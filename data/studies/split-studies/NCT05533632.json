Participants will get a once-weekly subcutaneous injection of semaglutide in doses decided by the study doctor's criteria, according to participant's personal needs. The study will last for about 24 weeks. Participants will have 4 clinic visits and 2 phone calls. Participants will have 3 laboratory tests during the study (blood and urine samples)."
