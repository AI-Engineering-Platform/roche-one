      "briefSummary": "Cough is the most common presenting symptom to family physician. Chronic Cough affects approximately 10-12% of the general population and is one of the commonest reasons for referral to secondary care. Unfortunately, there are no licensed treatments for this debilitating condition, which is associated with a poor quality of life, affecting the social, physical and psychological well-being of patients.\n\nThe aim of this single-centre proof-of-concept study is to investigate whether mepolizumab reduces objective cough frequency in patients with eosinophilic asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis presenting with chronic cough. Secondary outcomes including the effects on quality of life, the intensity of irritant sensations, airway hyper-reactivity and inflammatory cells and their progenitors will also be evaluated.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that in patients with asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, eosinophils are involved in sensitizing airway nerves and thereby increasing spontaneous objective coughs. The investigators predict that treatment with mepolizumab will reduce airway eosinophilia in patients with chronic cough due to eosinophilic asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, thereby causing a reduction in objective cough frequency.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a 9-visit randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase IV study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mepolizumab for the treatment of refractory chronic cough in patients with eosinophilic airway disease. Patients will be recruited from secondary care clinics. Patient eligibility will be assessed against the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and patients will undergo informed consent in the research centre. Subjects who provide informed consent and are enrolled in the study will undergo screening procedures.\n\nThe study will consist of a Mepolizumab treatment arm and placebo arm (normal saline). Fifteen subjects will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm and fifteen subjects will be randomly assigned to the placebo arm in a 1:1 ratio. Following screening and randomization, subjects will under an 12-week treatment period during which they will receive 4 doses of the study drug at days 0, 28, 56, and 84. The primary study outcomes will be measured at week 14 week, 2 weeks following the treatment period.\n\nAt Visit 1 (screening), subjects will undergo screening procedures: complete medical history, physical examination, methacholine challenge, spirometry, sputum induction, and blood sampling. Subjects will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and modified Borg Scale.\n\nAt Visit 2, subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.\n\nAt Visit 3, 24-hour cough monitors will be removed and subjects will undergo spirometry, blood sampling and sputum induction. Subjects will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale. The first dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a study physician.\n\nAt Visit 4, subjects will undergo spirometry and blood sampling and complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale. The second dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a study physician.\n\nAt Visit 5, the third dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a study physician. Subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.\n\nAt Visit 6, 24-hour cough monitors will be removed and subjects will undergo spirometry, sputum induction and blood sampling and complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale.\n\nAt Visit 7, subjects will undergo spirometry and blood sampling and complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale. The fourth dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a study physician.\n\nAt Visit 8, subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.\n\nAt Visit 9, the 24-hour cough monitors will be removed and subjects will undergo spirometry, methacholine challenge, sputum induction, and blood sampling. Subjects will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale.\n\nAll study procedures will be performed according to local standard operating procedures and be conducted by trained and experienced staff with supervision by medical doctors. Study physicians will administer all study drug injections. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring for adverse events and serious adverse events."

Subjects with a history of hepatitis B vaccination without history of hepatitis B can enroll.\n20. A history of immunodeficiency disorders including a positive human immunodeficiency virus test\n21. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n22. Women of childbearing potential must not be actively seeking pregnancy, and must use an effective form of birth control (confirmed by the Investigator). Effective forms of birth control include: true sexual abstinence, a vasectomized sexual partner, Implanon, female sterilization by tubal occlusion, any effective intrauterine device/ intrauterine system levonorgestrel Intrauterine system, Depo-Provera™ injections, oral contraceptive, and Evra Patch™ or Nuvaring™. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control, as defined above, from enrolment, throughout the study duration and within the 8 treatment weeks. They must demonstrate a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and demonstrate a negative urine pregnancy test immediately before each dose of study drug or placebo. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n    i. Women \\<50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range.\n\n    ii. Women ≥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.\n23. Male patients not using an acceptable method of contraception. All male patients who are sexually active must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception (condom with or without spermicide, vasectomy) from the first dose of study drug until their last dose.\n24. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors\n25. Use of immunosuppressive medication (including but not limited to: methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, intramuscular long-acting depot corticosteroid, oral corticosteroid, or any experimental anti-inflammatory therapy) within 3 months prior to the date informed consent is obtained\n26. Use of any other biological within 4 months or 5 half-lives prior to randomization, whichever is longer.\n27. Any centrally acting medication within the last 2 weeks which in the view of the investigator could influence the coughing (Any participant who is taking amitriptyline, dextromethorphan, pregabalin, gabapentin or opioids will not be eligible to take part in this study unless they are willing and medically able to withdraw from such medication for the duration of the study. The reason for this is that centrally acting medications may influence coughing rates.)\n28.
