Skin disease/disorder that might interfere with the diagnosis or evaluation of acne vulgaris vi. Evidence of recent alcohol or drug abuse. vii. History of poor cooperation, non-compliance with medical treatment, or unreliability.\n\nviii. Exposure to an investigational drug study within 30 days of the Baseline Visit.\n\nix. Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, any components of the formulation, or lincomycin.
