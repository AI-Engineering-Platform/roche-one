Scores were calculated by summing the responses within each domain and by taking the average. Scale scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 range, with 0 implying the lowest level of functioning and 100 for the highest level of functioning. The CSS was calculated as the average of Physical Limitation Score and Total Symptom Score (TSS) and the TSS was calculated as the average of Symptom Frequency and Symptom Burden Scores.\n\nThe change from randomisation in KCCQ-CSS is reported.",
