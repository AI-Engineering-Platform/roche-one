      "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the effect of FDA-approved antiseizure drugs in the brain connectivity patterns of severe and moderate acute brain injury patients with suppression of consciousness. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the antiseizure medication reduce the functional connectivity of seizure networks, as identified by resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), within this specific target population?\n* What is the prevalence of seizure networks in patients from the target population, both with EEG suggestive and not suggestive of epileptogenic activity?\n\nParticipants will have a rs-fMRI and those with seizure networks will receive treatment with two antiseizure medications and a post-treatment rs-fMRI. Researchers will compare the pretreatment and post-treatment rs-fMRIs to see if there are changes in the participant's functional connectivity including seizure networks and typical resting state networks."

SzNET- participants will not undergo further interventions or tests, while SzNET+ subjects will be assigned to the intervention arm and will receive follow-up rsfMRI and EEG.\n\nThe study aims to fill 2 quotas in its intervention arm: Participants who are both SzNET+ and EEG+, and another for those SzNET+ but EEG-. Once either of these quotas is complete, the study will cease screening subjects with EEG results falling into that quota. The subjects discharged from hospital on antiseizure medications for medical reasons will be followed up at 3 months post-discharge to collect exploratory data",

The power spectrum graph shows the BOLD signal's power density over multiple frequencies, measured in Hz/100. Power Spectrum (PS) is the sum of the PS of the SzNET independent components normalized by their spatial volumes. Functional scans were co-registered to the anatomical T1 image, visually inspected, and subjected to independent component analysis (ICA) using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) tool MELODIC. ICA was applied to separate the BOLD signal into independent components generated by brain networks, which were evaluated for suspected seizure onset zones (SOZs) based on spatial and temporal features.

The power spectrum graph shows the BOLD signal's power density over multiple frequencies, measured in Hz/100. Power Spectrum (PS) is the sum of the PS of the SzNET independent components normalized by their spatial volumes. Functional scans were co-registered to the anatomical T1 image, visually inspected, and subjected to independent component analysis (ICA) using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) tool MELODIC. ICA was applied to separate the BOLD signal into independent components generated by brain networks, which were evaluated for suspected seizure onset zones (SOZs) based on spatial and temporal features. Pre- and post-intervention Rs-fMRI medians were found from the normalized and volume-adjusted area under the curve of the SzNET PS curve above 6.78 Hz/100.",

One volume from the fMRI is a complete slice of the brain's activity at a specific point of time. Over the 20-minute period that the rs-fMRI is performed, many volumes are collected at different time points continuously throughout the scan. These volume elements are measured in units of voxels which are a 3D unit of the MRI image. SzNET total volume (TV) is the sum of the volumes of the SzNET independent components, collected through ICA where independent components generated by brain networks were evaluated for suspected seizure onset zones. The medians from the normalized volume of the total seizure networks, of both pre and post-intervention rs-fMRI, were collected from this data.",
