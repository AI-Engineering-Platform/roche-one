Since there is no prospective study on different FiO2 and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) during cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that hyperoxia during cardiac surgery could lead to higher incidence of lung injury and PPCs than normoxia. The objective of this trial is to compare postoperative PPCs and other outcomes between hyperoxia and normoxia strategy by PaO2/FiO2 in CABG patients."
