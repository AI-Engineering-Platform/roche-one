      "briefSummary": "DATURA trial is a phase III, multicenter, two-arm, open-label, randomized superiority trial to compare the efficacy and the safety of an intensified tuberculosis (TB) regimen versus standard TB treatment in HIV-infected adults and adolescents hospitalized for TB with CD4 ≤ 100 cells/μL over 48 weeks:\n\n* Intensified TB treatment regimen: increased doses of rifampicin and isoniazid together with standard-dose of pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 8 weeks in addition to prednisone for 6 weeks and albendazole for 3 days\n* WHO standard TB treatment regimen.\n\nThe continuation phase of TB treatment will be identical in the two arms: 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid at standard doses.",
      "detailedDescription": "Settings: 5 African (Cameroon, Guinea, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique) and 1 South-East Asian (Cambodia) countries.\n\nSample size : 1330 patients (665 in each arm). Follow-up : 48 weeks after entry in the trial (TB treatment initiation).\n\nAll participants will initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) 2 weeks after starting TB treatment. In each country, the chosen ART regimen will be the same in both arms. According to the first-line regimen recommended in each country, the ART combination will be TDF/3TC/EFV 600 mg, or TDF/3TC + double-dose DTG.\n\nThe primary objective is to estimate the impact of an intensified initial phase of TB treatment on mortality at 48 weeks among HIV-infected adults and adolescents hospitalized for TB with CD4 ≤ 100 cells/μL in comparison with standard TB treatment.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to estimate the impact of an intensified initial phase of TB treatment, in comparison with the standard TB regimen, on:\n\n* Mortality at weeks 8 and 24\n* Adverse events, including\n\n  * All grade 3 and 4 events\n  * Selected grade 2 events of interest\n  * Drug-related adverse events\n  * AIDS-defining illnesses\n  * Paradoxical TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)\n* TB treatment success\n* TB recurrence\n* ART response in terms of virological success and immunological response\n* Adherence to TB treatment and ART\n* Peak plasma concentrations of rifampicin and isoniazid (and its N-acetyl-metabolite) at day 3, day 7 and week 2\n* Plasma concentrations of efavirenz and dolutegravir at week 4 (i.e. 2 weeks after the onset of ART).\n\nA pharmacokinetic sub-study of rifampicin and isoniazid will be carried out in 72 voluntary patients (6 patients/arm/country) at the second week of the main study."
