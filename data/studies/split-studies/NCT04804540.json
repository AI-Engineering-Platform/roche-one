      "briefSummary": "Vedolizumab is a medicine that helps to reduce inflammation and pain in the digestive system. In this study, people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will be treated with vedolizumab. The main aim of the study is to check for side effects from vedolizumab.\n\nAt the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants will receive vedolizumab slowly through a vein (infusion). Participants will regularly visit the clinic for up to 46 weeks for more infusions of Vedolizumab. During these visits, the study doctor will check if there are any side effects from this treatment.\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic for a final check-up up to 16 weeks after their final infusion of Vedolizumab. Clinic staff will arrange a phone call 6 months after their final infusion of Vedolizumab for a further check-up.",
      "detailedDescription": "The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to treat people who have active UC or CD.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 150 patients. Participants will be assigned to the vedolizumab treatment group.\n\n•Vedolizumab 300 mg\n\nVedolizumab 300 mg IV infusion will be administered once in Weeks 0, 2, 6 and 10 (CD-participants who have not shown a response can receive a dose at Week 10) during induction phase and in Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38 and 46 during maintenance phase.\n\nThis multicentre trial will be conducted in India. The overall time to participate in this study is 74 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone plus a final visit after receiving their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment."
