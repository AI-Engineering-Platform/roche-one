          "description": "The SELENA-SLEDAI score is a cumulative and weighted index for assessing SLE disease activity in participants with SLE. It consists of 24 disease descriptors related to signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, and physician's assessment across 9 organ systems. Each descriptor is assigned a weighted score (8 descriptors with a weight of 8 each, 6 descriptors with a weight of 4 each, 7 descriptors with a weight of 2 each, and 3 descriptors with a weight of 1 each) which is added up if the descriptor is observed during a visit or within the preceding 10 days. The total score ranges from 0 (no disease activity) to 105 (all 24 descriptors present simultaneously). A higher score indicates a more significant degree of disease activity. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Percentage of participants with a decrease of 4 points or more in the score at each visit compared to their Baseline score is presented.",
          "populationDescription": "ITT population. 1 participant with Baseline SELENA-SLEDAI score below 4 was excluded. All 66 participants served as denominator to calculate percentages at each visit. For all visits except Week 52 (where percentage value was rounded off as no data was missing), missing data from missed visits were handled by multiple imputation. Estimates generated for every imputed dataset were combined by Rubin's rules to obtain percentages. So reported percentages may not yield whole number of participants.",

A mild/moderate SFI flare involves: a SELENA-SLEDAI score increase of 3 to 12 points (higher score means greater disease activity); SLE symptom development; prednisone dose increase (but not above 0.5 milligrams per kilogram per day \\[mg/kg/day\\]); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/hydroxychloroquine addition; or PGA score increase by 1 or more, but not to more than 2.5 (higher score means greater disease activity). A severe SFI flare involves: SELENA-SLEDAI score increase over 12 points; onset or worsening of severe SLE symptoms; prednisone dose increase above 0.5 mg/kg/day; introduction of potent immunosuppressants; hospitalization; or PGA score reaching 2.5 or higher. Time to first SLE flare (mild/moderate or severe) was the number of days from treatment start date until the participant met an event. Time to first flare was defined as event date minus treatment start date plus 1.",
