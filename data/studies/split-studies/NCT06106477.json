      "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm pilot study (n=20) designed to evaluate whether a six-month intermittent fasting (IF) intervention, defined as a daily recurring fourteen-hour nightly fasting period, is feasible to adhere to and feasible to determine health outcomes in breast cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 and who are scheduled to start adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) after definitive therapy.\n\nSubjects with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer will be enrolled into this study. Data on study feasibility, quality of life (QOL) and anthropometric measurements, and biomarkers will be collected and analyzed. After the study is completed, the investigators may also perform a post-hoc analysis on subjects who received adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with AET vs. AET alone."

      "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Breast cancer patients ≥ 18 years old who are willing to consent to an approximately 14-hour nighttime fasting period and an approximately 10-hour daytime eating period.\n2. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 negative (HER2-) localized breast cancer (stages I-III).\n\n   1. Progesterone receptor positive or negative patients are allowed.\n   2. Hormone receptor positivity is defined as ER positivity in at least 1% cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER 2-negative breast cancer is defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), or silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) test is required.\n3. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25.\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2.\n5. Subject must be willing to start the intermittent fasting (IF) intervention within three months of starting adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET), or at the discretion of the treating providers, and within 30 days of study enrollment.\n6. Subjects who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy must have recovered completely from chemotherapy-related side effects such as nausea/emesis as determined by the treating providers.\n7. Subjects who received neoadjuvant endocrine therapy are eligible only after completion of their definitive surgery (i.e., when ready to start adjuvant endocrine therapy) and treating provider ensures complete closure and healing of surgical incisions.\n8.

Presence of endocrine disorders prone to fluctuations in blood sugar (e.g., multiple neuroendocrine disorders, adrenal disorders, chronic hypoglycemia).\n7.

Poorly controlled co-existing cardiac disease as determined by the treating physician, such as chronic hypotension, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association III-IV), unstable angina, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia).\n9.
