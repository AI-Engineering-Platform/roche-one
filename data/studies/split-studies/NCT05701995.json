It assesses how much a skin condition affects various aspects of daily life, including symptoms, feelings, daily activities, work or school, personal relationships, and treatment.\n\nThe DLQI is scored by summing the responses to its 10 questions. Each question is scored on a scale from 0 to 3:\n\n0 = Not at all\n\n1. = A little\n2. = A lot\n3. = Very much The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating a greater impact on the patient's quality of life.",
