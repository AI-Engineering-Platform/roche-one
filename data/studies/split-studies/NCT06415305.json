      "briefSummary": "Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease in patients with skin of color and second most common in Caucasian population. The global prevalence is thought to be as high as 60-80% in individuals 12-25 years of age. However, it is not limited to only teenagers but also to adults, especially adult females. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial. Genetics may also play a role. The treatment pathway should be directed to different pathogenic factors including, excessive sebum production, hyper keratinization, P. acnes, and inflammation.\n\nData is limited for skin of color patients in Phase III registration trials. Data is limited because there are few studies that focus on patients with skin of color. Therefore, a unique study dedicated to patients with skin of color in a real-world setting will be welcome to add further evidence to phase III data."
