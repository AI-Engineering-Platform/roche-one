Each pair of individuals undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures typically possess grade 1 (G1) embryos during the embryo transfer process.\n3. The age range of the female participants varied from 18 to 40 years.\n4. Infertility arising from female factors, including issues like blocked fallopian tubes, lack of ovulation, and unexplained fertility challenges, was examined.\n5. Male-related factors contributing to infertility were also taken into consideration.\n6. The procedure involved the transfer of grade one embryos during a fresh cycle.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nEndometrioses, whether clinically suspected or discovered during laparoscopy, are of interest.\n\n2\\. Instances of congenital abnormalities in the reproductive system are being examined.\n\n3\\. Individuals above the age of forty are under consideration. 4. Individuals who do not possess G1 embryos are also included. 5. Patients with chronic systemic conditions (such as diabetes, hematologic disorders, hypertension, autoimmune disorders of the connective tissue, asthma, thyroid disorders) are a part of the study.\n\n6\\. The presence of empty follicles is noted in stimulated cycles where no oocytes were obtained during the aspiration procedure.\n\n\\-",
