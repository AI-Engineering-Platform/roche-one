      "briefSummary": "The BEST Trial (Biomarkers for Evaluating Spine Treatments) is a National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)-sponsored clinical trial being conducted through the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative's Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program. The primary objective of this trial is to inform a precision medicine approach to the treatment of Chronic Low-Back Pain by estimating the optimal treatment or combination of treatments based on patient features and response to the initial treatment. Interventions being evaluated in this trial are: (1) enhanced self-care (ESC), (2) acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), (3) evidence-based exercise and manual therapy (EBEM), and (4) duloxetine.",
      "detailedDescription": "Each participant will complete an initial screening call and enrollment visit, followed by a 2-week run-in period, two consecutive 12-week treatment periods, and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. Upon completion of the run-in period, participant eligibility will be reassessed based on adherence to study protocol. Participants who no longer meet eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures and discontinued from the study.\n\nAll participants will undergo phenotyping assessments at Visit 0, 1 and 2 corresponding to baseline, the end of the first 12-week intervention period, and the end of the second 12-week intervention period, respectively. A subset of participants will undergo additional phenotyping, consisting of a more comprehensive set of phenotyping assessments, at the same visits.\n\nPain, Enjoyment of Life, and General Activity (PEG) and Patient Global Impressions Scale (PGIC) will be assessed at 6 weeks (midpoint of intervention period one), 12 weeks (Visit 1), 18 weeks (midpoint of intervention period two), 24 weeks (Visit 2), and 36 weeks post-baseline (12 weeks after intervention period two). Basic safety assessments will also be performed at these time points to assess participant tolerability to their current study intervention(s). Patients who are unable to tolerate their assigned study treatment will be educated on how to safely discontinue their current treatment plan but will otherwise remain in the study."

Online sessions will focus on helping participants accept pain, connect with negative thoughts and emotions, develop mindfulness and identify and commit to values and goals that are important to them. During face-to-face sessions with the therapist, participants will be encouraged to share their experience of skills practice and mastery, provide examples of skill use at home, and describe what barriers they encountered.",

At the time of randomization, the approved drug pharmacy at each study site will dispense between 185 and 192 duloxetine 30 mg capsules and provide to participants.

In Period 1, participants randomized to ACT took part in 12 therapy sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Each participant was scheduled for a combination of 4 remote face-to-face visits and 8 therapist-supported online sessions, which included a self-directed module combined with personalized provider coaching delivered via an online messaging system. In Period 2, strong responders were encouraged to continue to practice ACT skills at home without therapist supervision and were given access to an additional 11 ACT audio modules."

The goal of ACT is to build psychological flexibility thereby interrupting pain avoidance behavior patterns. Participants randomized to ACT will take part in 12 sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Sessions will be delivered as a combination of 4 remote face-to-face visits with a therapist and 8 therapist-supported online sessions (self-directed online modules supported by provider coaching). Online sessions will focus on helping participants accept pain, connect with negative thoughts and emotions, develop mindfulness and identify and commit to values and goals that are important to them. During face-to-face sessions with the therapist, participants will be encouraged to share their experience of skills practice and mastery, provide examples of skill use at home, and describe what barriers they encountered."

Study participants will be treated with duloxetine for 12 weeks during the active treatment phase. At the time of randomization, the approved drug pharmacy at each study site will dispense between 185 and 192 duloxetine 30 mg capsules and provide to participants. This will ensure enough capsules to maintain up to a 60 mg dosage through the 12-week intervention phase and to taper the dose in the 13th week if needed."

Special attention will be paid to the clinician's choice of language in regard to the purpose and expected outcomes of manual therapy in order to avoid enhancing catastrophizing ideations or preference for passive interventions. A total of 10 sessions will be provided over an 8-week treatment period. Two sessions per week are provided in the first two weeks followed by weekly sessions over the next 6 weeks. Treatment sessions will last approximately 60 minutes each."

These modules will be provided digitally for self-administration over a period of 12 weeks. There will be no therapist associated with the delivery of these educational materials; however, after the first four modules, email or text messages will be used to make personalized recommendations for accessing additional modules based upon identified problems from the baseline assessment. Additionally, the walking program module will utilize Fitbit step tracking to allow participants to monitor their walking progress."

The goal of ACT is to build psychological flexibility thereby interrupting pain avoidance behavior patterns. Participants randomized to ACT will take part in 12 sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Sessions will be delivered as a combination of 4 remote face-to-face visits with a therapist and 8 therapist-supported online sessions (self-directed online modules supported by provider coaching). Online sessions will focus on helping participants accept pain, connect with negative thoughts and emotions, develop mindfulness and identify and commit to values and goals that are important to them. During face-to-face sessions with the therapist, participants will be encouraged to share their experience of skills practice and mastery, provide examples of skill use at home, and describe what barriers they encountered."

As this precision-medicine focus dictates individualized rather than arm-level contrasts, no between-arm comparative-effectiveness analyses are planned as primary analyses. The primary goal of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers for each treatment not comparative effectiveness."
