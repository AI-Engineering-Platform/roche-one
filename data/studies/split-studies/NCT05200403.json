      "briefSummary": "This single blind study is to primarily evaluate wearable devices and Observer Reported Itch Assessment in children to assess reduction of itch and night-time scratch in response to Crisaborole treatment vs. vehicle treatment (active control comparator without crisaborole) in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). Participants, age 3 months to 11 years with symptomatic mild to moderate AD, along with their primary caregivers will be recruited.\n\nThe goal of this study is to more fully evaluate the rapid onset of night-time itch and scratch relief, as well as improvements in sleep following treatment with Crisaborole in comparison to vehicle treatment in children with AD. the study will also assess the quality of life (QoL) and sleep within the associated caregivers.",
      "detailedDescription": "Approximately 270 children participants, age 3 months to ≤ 11 years, and their primary caregiver participants, for a total of 540 participants (270 pairs) will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to either Crisaborole (2% BID) or vehicle treatment and will be followed for 2 weeks. Participants will be asked to apply a thin even-layer of Crisaborole (2%) or vehicle twice daily (BID), excluding mouth, eyes, and vagina, per label, to all locations with active lesions (except for hands/fingers or within 1 to 2 fingers of the mouth to avoid inadvertent ingestion of ointment) and record location and time of application on the daily dosing form (provided by study staff, and as identified on the Dosing Record Sheet, breastfeeding women will be instructed to use the provided gloves when applying Crisaborole/vehicle). The study will be comprised of an initial screening/baseline visit for children participants who have an existing diagnosis of symptomatic AD, screened and enrolled in the study along with their primary caregivers after signing an informed consent (for parents/guardians and assent when appropriate).\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n1\\. Evaluate the effects of Crisaborole on itch and night-time scratch (as measured by accelerometry/actigraphy and Observer Reported Itch Assessment (3 months to ≤ 11 years old)) in children with mild to moderate AD between the ages of 3 months to ≤ 11 years old.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Evaluate the effects of Crisaborole on sleep in children ages 3 months to ≤ 11 years with mild to moderate AD.\n2. Evaluate sleep in primary caregivers.\n3. Evaluate the QoL measures in response to Crisaborole treatment (children 3 months to ≤ 11 years).\n4. Evaluate QoL measures in response to the child's treatment, to the parents/caregivers/families.\n5. Evaluate the effect of crisaborole treatment on AD signs, symptoms and severity in children ages 3 months to ≤ 11 years with mild to moderate AD.\n\nThe study will consist of a screening/baseline (in-laboratory) visit on Day -7 (V01), an in-laboratory visit Day 1 (V02), an in-laboratory visit on Day 2 (V03) for tape-striping, and Day 8 (V04) for a clinical assessment of the severity of the AD and a final in-laboratory visit on Day 15 (V05) for an assessment of the AD, tape-stripping, completion of ObsROs and return devices. Throughout the study, the participants and caregivers will wear accelerometry devices continuously (optional for those who have active AD on location of device placement, with a minimum of at least one wrist device needed for enrollment; devices may be removed for short periods of time for such things as the purposes of bathing, etc.). Enrolled participants will be randomly assigned to each arm of the study. Participants may come in for an unscheduled visit as needed (i.e., to replace compound, etc.). All in-person study activities, including informed consent and pregnancy testing, will be completed at the Laboratory for Human Neurobiology, 650 Albany St X140, Boston, MA, 02118. All activities performed in the laboratory are accomplished in private rooms. Primary caregivers will be provided with ample time and a privacy curtain to change into a gown during assessment for exclusion of Atopic Dermatitis, and primary caregivers will accompany children during all activities to ensure participant privacy. All at-home study activities will be completed in the participants' home."
