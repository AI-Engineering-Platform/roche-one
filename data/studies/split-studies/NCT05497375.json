      "briefSummary": "It is unknown whether different end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure levels have a clinically significant effect on bleeding and surgical field quality in septorhinoplasty, especially during controlled hypotension. Therefore, it was aimed to investigate the effect of ventilation strategy with controlled hypocapnia on intraoperative bleeding and surgical field quality for commonly practiced in septorhinoplasty.",
      "detailedDescription": "Septorhinoplasty is one of the most common esthetic surgeries in the world. The septorhinoplasty is accompanied by insignificant bleeding on the surgical field. Excessive bleeding compromises the surgical field quality and makes more difficult the septorhinoplasty. It is very important to control and minimize excessive bleeding in surgical field by different approaches of anesthesia management. Successful approaches to reduce the excessive bleeding are; controlled hypotension by keeping the mean arterial pressure in the range of 60-70 mmHg, the reverse Trendelenburg position of the patient, administration of adrenaline (injection prior to surgery or packing soaked during surgery), and administration of tranexamic acid, which are applicable methods in many clinical centers.\n\nCardiac output may vary depending on the autonomic nervous system. The dominance of parasympathetic system effect may cause vasodilation, decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output. This vasodilation may increase bleeding during septorhinoplasty and worsen the surgical field quality. Anesthesia management may provide a clear view for the surgeon and an improved surgical field quality. The effect of carbon dioxide on vascular reactivity deserves an extra attention in septorhinoplasty required bleeding control. The intensity of bleeding in septorhinoplasty is mainly affected by mean arterial pressure and heart rate. At the same time, blood flow can be affected directly by carbon dioxide on the smooth muscular tonus of the arterioles.\n\nAfter all, it is unknown whether different carbon dioxide pressure levels have a clinically significant effect on bleeding and surgical field quality in septorhinoplasty, especially during controlled hypotension. Therefore, it was aimed to investigate the effect of ventilation strategy with controlled hypocapnia on intraoperative bleeding and surgical field quality for commonly practiced in septorhinoplasty."
