      "briefSummary": "RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by therapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the normal organ and tumor dosimetry with yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 using indium In 111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 as pretherapy in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Evaluate the extent and duration of antitumor response in these patients on this regimen.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y hMN-14). Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) on days -17 to -13, followed by leukapheresis on days -14 to -12. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested, bone marrow is also collected. Patients receive pretherapy targeting consisting of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 over 30 minutes on day -7. At least 1 confirmed tumor site must be targeted. Patients receive 90Y hMN-14 IV over 30-45 minutes on day 0. PBSC is reinfused within 7 to 14 days after 90 hMN-14 administration. Patients receive G-CSF SQ or IV until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as either the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity or the threshold radiation doses to lungs, kidney, and liver are reached. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, every 2 weeks for 2 months, monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 5 years.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
