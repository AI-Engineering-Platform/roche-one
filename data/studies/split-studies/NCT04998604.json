Total score of Nasal domain was average score of items of nasal domain, and ranged from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be), where higher score indicated greater rhinosinusitis-related health burden. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement in health-related quality of life. Baseline was defined as last available valid (non-missing) value up to and including day of first administration of study treatment.",
