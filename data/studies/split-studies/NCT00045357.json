      "briefSummary": "RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Treating a person's white blood cells in the laboratory and reinfusing them may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells for cellular adoptive immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n* Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n* Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD4+ antigen-specific T-cell clones in these patients.\n\nSecondary\n\n* Determine the antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients undergo leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD4+ antigen-specific T-cell clones are generated over the next 2-3 months using immunogenic peptides MART1, tyrosinase, or gp100.\n\nPatients receive autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells IV over 30 minutes.\n\nCohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed on days 1 and 3 post T-cell infusion, and then once weekly for 12 weeks.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
