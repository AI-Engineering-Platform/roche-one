Surgically sterile (has had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy), or\n   2. If heterosexually active, practicing a highly effective method of birth control, including hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, double-barrier method (eg, condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap, with spermicidal foam, cream, film, gel or suppository), or male partner sterilization, consistent with local regulations regarding use of birth control methods for subjects participating in clinical trials, for a period of 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent, OR\n   3. Not heterosexually active. Note: If a woman participant's childbearing potential changes after start of the study (e.g., a pre-menarchal woman experiences menarche) or if women of childbearing potential who are not heterosexually active at screening become heterosexually active, they must agree to utilize a highly effective method of birth control, as described above.\n7.

Has a transplanted organ (except for corneal transplant performed \\> 3 months prior to screening).\n15. Has a history of lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma, or signs and symptoms suggestive of possible lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or location (e.g., nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, supraclavicular, epitrochlear, or paraaortic areas), or splenomegaly.\n16. Has previously undergone allergy immunotherapy for prevention of anaphylactic reactions.\n17. Is unable or unwilling to undergo multiple venipunctures because of poor tolerability or lack of easy access to veins.\n18. Has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to ustekinumab or excipients (refer to the ustekinumab prescribing information).\n19. Has a clinically significant substance abuse problem (eg, drugs or alcohol) at screening or during the previous 12 months prior to baseline.\n20. Any biologic or small molecule therapy within 4 weeks of start of ustekinumab.\n21. Positive quantiferon gold that is not being treated and followed by Infectious Disease\n22. Tests positive for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), regardless of the results of other hepatitis B tests. Subjects who test positive only for core antibody (anti-HBc) must undergo further testing for hepatitis B DNA acid (HBV DNA test). If the HBV DNA test is positive, the subject is not eligible for this study. If the HBV DNA test is negative, the subject is eligible for this study. In the event the HBV DNA test cannot be performed, the subject is not eligible for this study.\n23. Change in dose of 6-MP, methotrexate, or azathioprine within one month of the start of ustekinumab.\n24. Change in prednisone or budesonide dose within 2 weeks of start of ustekinumab\n25. Change in mesalamine dosage within 2 weeks of start of ustekinumab\n26. Has a stool culture or other examination positive for an enteric pathogen, including Clostridium difficile toxin, in the last 4 months unless a repeat examination is negative and there are no signs of ongoing infection with that pathogen\n27. Has received a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination within 12 months or any other live bacterial or live viral vaccination within 2 weeks of baseline.\n28. Have immune deficiency syndrome (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, T-cell deficiency syndromes, B-cell deficiency syndromes, and chronic granulomatous disease).\n29.
