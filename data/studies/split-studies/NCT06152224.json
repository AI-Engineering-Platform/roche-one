      "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about how the duration of use of The Leva Pelvic Health System® affects treatment of fecal incontinence in women. The main question it aims to answer is to test whether use of the The Leva Pelvic Health System® for 8 weeks is as good as using it for 16 weeks.\n\nParticipants will complete surveys, and use the Leva device.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study will assess whether 8 weeks of use of the Leva Pelvic Health System (Leva) is non-inferior to 16 weeks of use for the treatment of chronic fecal incontinence (symptoms \\>/= 3 months) in adults with a vagina. Participants will be instructed to complete pelvic floor muscle training using the Leva for 8 or 16 weeks.\n\nThe hypothesis is that 8 weeks of use of Leva is non-inferior to 16 weeks of use, assessed by a validated FI symptom severity survey. Surveys will be completed at 0 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks. Long-term surveys will be completed at 1 year and 2 years from enrollment."
