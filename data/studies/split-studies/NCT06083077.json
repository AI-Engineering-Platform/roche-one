      "briefSummary": "Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of admission to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for respiratory distress.\n\nThe care of an infant with severe bronchiolitis is mainly based on symptomatic treatment (nutritional and respiratory support). The lower part of an infant's chest is larger than that of an older child, which can flatten the diaphragm, especially in obstructive disease with air trapping. Strapping the lower part (at the junction of the chest and abdomen) may provide a better condition for diaphragmatic contraction. Based on respiratory mechanics in infants and physiological studies in adults, investigators hypothesise that chest wall strapping may improve the ventilation and the diaphragmatic contraction.\n\nInfant \\< 6 month with severe bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU will be recorded in 4 conditions with or without chest wall strapping and with a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) at 7 cmH2O or without CPAP. Physiological parameters (including work of breathing, respiratory parameters, distribution of ventilation) will be recorded and analysed."
