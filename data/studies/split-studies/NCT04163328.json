      "briefSummary": "HydroEye® is a dietary omega 3 fatty acid supplement that contains both EPA and DHA, as well as GLA and ALA in the form of black currant seed oil. It also has vitamins A, E, C, B6, and magnesium, many of which are involved in fatty acid metabolism. In 2013, Sheppard et al. tested HydroEye® in dry eye patients who were not contact lens wearers and found that symptoms and corneal smoothness improved in response to HydroEye® supplementation. To date, HydroEye® has not been assessed in patients with contact lens discomfort; therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of HydroEye® as a treatment for contact lens discomfort."
