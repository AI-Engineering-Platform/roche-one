TSQM-9 measures participant satisfaction with the medication in 3 domains: Effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e., 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 to 6 for convenience, and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. The lowest possible score (1 for each item and 3 for all 3 subscales) was subtracted from the composite score and divided by the greatest possible score range. The greatest range was (7-1) x 3 items = 18 for effectiveness and convenience, and (5-1) x 3 items = 12 for global satisfaction. This provided a transformed score between 0 and 1 that was then multiplied by 100. TSQM-9 domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction for that domain.

Participant were asked to respond on how much their skin condition bothered them in the week prior to administration of the Skindex-16. Each item was scored on a scale ranged from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered), where higher score indicated continued/more botheration. Item scores are transformed to 0 to 100 scale, and domain scores are calculated as the average of the item scores comprising the domain. Net positive changes in respective subscale scoring indicates improvement in that particular quality of life assessment (i.e., Symptoms, Emotions, Functioning), while net negative changes in scoring indicates decrease in that particular quality of life assessment.",

TSQM-9 measures participant satisfaction with the medication in 3 domains: Effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e., 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 to 6 for convenience, and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. The lowest possible score (1 for each item and 3 for all 3 subscales) was subtracted from the composite score and divided by the greatest possible score range. The greatest range was (7-1) x 3 items = 18 for effectiveness and convenience, and (5-1) x 3 items = 12 for global satisfaction. This provided a transformed score between 0 and 1 that was then multiplied by 100. TSQM-9 domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction for that domain. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.",

The Skindex-16 consisted of 16 items that were divided into three sub-scores: Symptoms (four items, range 0-24), Emotions (seven items, range 0-42), and Functioning (five items, range 0-30). Participant were asked to respond on how much their skin condition bothered them in the week prior to administration of the Skindex-16. Each item was scored on a scale ranged from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered), where higher score indicated continued/more botheration. Item scores are transformed to 0 to 100 scale, and domain scores are calculated as the average of the item scores comprising the domain. Net positive changes in respective subscale scoring indicates improvement in that particular quality of life assessment (i.e., Symptoms, Emotions, Functioning), while net negative changes in scoring indicates decrease in that particular quality of life assessment.",

The instrument is designed with 4 scales consisting of 14 questions. These 14 questions were derived from an original set of 55 questions extracted from exhaustive literature review and treatment groups through multistep iterative process. The 4 scales focused on effectiveness (questions: 1-3), side effects (questions: 4-8), convenience (questions: 9-11), global satisfaction (questions:12-14). Global Satisfaction- Question 12 scored as 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (extremely confident); question 13 scored as 1 (not at all certain) to 5 (extremely certain); and question 14 scored as 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to 7 (extremely satisfied). The scores of the domain were added together and an algorithm was used to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicated greater satisfaction.",

After scratching effects, a black or blue-black shade may appear; Olsen grade III: denotes \"late\" AK that have existed for a longer period of time and are firmly anchored on the lower surface, with an irregular, humpy surface, also wart-like and of different colors (white, brown, black).",
