      "briefSummary": "In this research study the investigators want to learn more about whether the medication Solriamfetol improves daytime sleepiness in workers who start work at very early times (between 3 and 6am).",
      "detailedDescription": "Shift work has become increasingly common as the 24/7 global society has required more and more workers to do their jobs at irregular hours. According to the National Health Interview Survey in 2010, approximately 28.7% of the American workforce is engaged in work outside a regular day shift (outside 7 AM-to 6 PM). Working irregular hours poses a serious threat to the shift worker's physical, mental, and psychosocial health due to circadian misalignment and misplaced sleep. The most severe problems faced by shift workers are sleep disturbances and excessive sleepiness. The disruptions caused by shift work are recognized as a circadian rhythm sleep disorder in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, and is called Shift Work Disorder \\[SWD\\]. SWD is characterized by excessive sleepiness (ES) during wakefulness, accompanied by a reduction of total sleep time and/or insomnia. Several studies have shown that 10-43% of shift workers are diagnosed with SWD, dependent on the criteria used.\n\nStudies have shown that wake promoting agents can be used to treat ES in shift workers, ranging from caffeine to prescription pharmacological agents. Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved options for SWD patients with ES are modafinil and armodafinil. A three-month, double-blind trial of 209 randomized SWD patients showed that modafinil improves wakefulness and the ability to sustain attention working night shifts without negatively affecting daytime sleep. Furthermore, SWD patients who received modafinil had an improvement in clinical symptoms, reduced levels of sleepiness during night shift and during commute home, and proportionally fewer patients reported motor vehicle accidents or near accidents while commuting home. Czeisler and colleagues also performed a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study, which showed that armodafinil was well-tolerated and improved clinical conditions, wakefulness, attention and memory during night shifts in SWD patients without jeopardizing daytime sleep and reduced sleepiness during the commute home.\n\nAll these previous studies were described in SWD patients working night shifts, yet approximately 3 times as many individuals work shifts that start in the early morning compared with those who work night shifts. These early-morning shift workers are a unique, high-risk group because their early work start times (3:00 AM to 6:00 AM) require the workers to wake up in the middle of the night, close to their circadian nadir, resulting in curtailed sleep and commuting to work during times of high sleepiness. Previous research has shown that early-morning shift starts in particular are associated with increased sleepiness. To the investigators' knowledge, no studies have addressed the use of wake promoting agents for ES in early-morning shift workers.\n\nIn this clinical trial, the investigators will test whether Solriamfetol (SUNOSITM), a drug approved for the treatment of ES in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, is effective in: (1) decreasing sleepiness without reducing sleep duration or sleep quality; (2) improving work functioning; and (3) improving quality of life in early-morning shift workers diagnosed with ES associated with SWD."
