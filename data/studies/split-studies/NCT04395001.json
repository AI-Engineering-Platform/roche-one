      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is is to determine if the combination of non-opioid medication (duloxetine) and web-based pain-coping skills training (PCST) is beneficial for individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP).",
      "detailedDescription": "With this study, the study team hopes to address two important unanswered questions: (1) Does combination treatment consisting of duloxetine and web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) optimize treatment outcomes? (2) Would adherence-focused guidance delivered by nurse clinician using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques enhance treatment effectiveness? This study is significant because the study team aims to optimize pain-related treatment outcomes at the primary care level where most patients with pain are managed. Importantly, the use of nurse clinician providing adherence-focused guidance (as opposed to content-focused guidance) on the continued practice (or use) of pain coping skills increases the likelihood that the study's intervention is scalable in the future. Effective, accessible and scalable psychoeducational treatments are needed to manage CMP in real world clinic settings."
