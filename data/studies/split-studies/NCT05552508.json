Mucus plugs was scored with a scoring system similar to that by Dunican et al. with the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) based on bronchopulmonary segmental anatomy. The mucus score was calculated by counting the number of bronchopulmonary segments which contained 1 or more mucus plug, up to a maximum score of 18 corresponding to the 18 bronchopulmonary segments present in most people. In this system, a mucus plug is defined as a complete occlusion of the airway visible at TLC. Each bronchopulmonary segment is given a score of 1 (mucus plug\\[s\\] present) or 0 (mucus plug\\[s\\] absent). The segment scores of each lobe are summed to generate a total mucus score for both lungs, yielding a mucus score ranging from 0-18. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.",

Mucus plugs was scored with a scoring system similar to that by Dunican et al. with SARP based on bronchopulmonary segmental anatomy. Mucus score was calculated by counting number of bronchopulmonary segments which contained 1 or more mucus plug, up to a maximum score of 18 corresponding to the 18 bronchopulmonary segments present in most people. In this system, a mucus plug is defined as a complete occlusion of airway visible at TLC. Each bronchopulmonary segment is given a score of 1 (mucus plug present) or 0 (mucus plug absent). The segment scores of each lobe are summed to generate a total mucus score for both lungs, yielding a mucus score ranging from 0-18. Higher scores = worse outcome.",

Mucus plugs was scored with a scoring system similar to that by Dunican et al. with SARP based on bronchopulmonary segmental anatomy. Mucus score was calculated by counting number of bronchopulmonary segments which contained 1 or more mucus plug, up to a maximum score of 18 corresponding to the 18 bronchopulmonary segments present in most people. In this system, a mucus plug is defined as a complete occlusion of airway visible at TLC. Each bronchopulmonary segment is given a score of 1 (mucus plug present) or 0 (mucus plug absent). The segment scores of each lobe are summed to generate a total mucus score for both lungs, yielding a mucus score ranging from 0-18. Higher scores = worse outcome.",
