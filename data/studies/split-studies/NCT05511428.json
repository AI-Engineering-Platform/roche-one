      "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the treatment effect of home based daratumumab administration in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Darzalex Faspro is a combination of two drugs (daratumumab and hyaluronidase) used to treat adults with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by helping the body to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Hyaluronidase-fihj is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep daratumumab in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect. Standard medical care requires Darzalex-Faspro treatment be administered during visits to the cancer center. Receiving medication in the home setting, may decrease cost and burden of care in patients with multiple myeloma.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Evaluate treatment burden (using the Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire \\[CTSQ\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine adherence to home delivery of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj (darzalex faspro).\n\nII. Evaluate quality of life (using European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire \\[EORTC QLQ-30\\]) based on site of care (home versus \\[vs.\\] infusion center).\n\nIII. Evaluate financial burden (using the COST survey) based on site of care (home vs. infusion center).\n\nIV. Evaluate Safety of home administration of darzalex-faspro. V. Evaluate barriers to home administration.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate patient perceptions of home administration of anti-neoplastic therapy.\n\nII. Evaluate opportunity cost based on site of care (home vs. infusion center) (using the Oncology Opportunity Cost Assessment Tool \\[OOCAT\\] survey).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj subcutaneously (SC) over 3-5 minutes in the infusion center on day 1 of cycles 1, 2, 7, and 8 and at home on day 1 of cycles 3, 4, 5, and 6. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 months."
