In this study, the intervention is the process of using an infusion center/ASA as the location to receive the CABENUVA IM injections. The acceptability and feasibility of the IC/ASA to deliver CABENUVA IM injections will be assessed from the perspectives of the participants, HIV care providers and IC/ASA staff. In this study, Month 1 is the Baseline visit. CABENUVA is a registered trademark of ViiV Healthcare."
