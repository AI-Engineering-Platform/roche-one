Similarly there are no accurate ways to track how these diseases progress in a very precise manner. Recording eye movements and pupils may be a very sensitive way of doing this and may contain important information about a patient's diagnosis and their cognitive and motor function.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesize that measuring eye movements and pupil changes while people watch short video clips will differentiate PD and atypical parkinsonism at an early stage. We hypothesize that eye movements and pupil changes will be able to track how a person's disease changes over time and could even predict their disease course from the start.\n\nBefore we can do this, we need to be able to accurately differentiate between PD and atypical parkinsonism and see how eye movements vary among people with the same disease.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nWe will ask a large number of people with PD and atypical parkinsonism to watch very brief video clips while we record eye movements and pupil responses. This is like changing the television channel every few seconds and observing what happens to a person's eyes as they search the new clip. We will compare these results between different disease groups and correlate them with clinical features of PD and atypical parkinsonism.\n\nImpact on Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson's disease:\n\nThis may have enormous impact in the assessment of people with PD. It may become an important diagnostic tool, a prognostic marker at the early stage of disease, as well as providing the ability to track disease progression in clinical trials.\n\nNext Steps for Development:\n\nOnce we can demonstrate that eye tracking can differentiate these conditions, we will follow a large number of patients to see how their eye movements and pupils change over time with their disease. If this is a reliable way to track disease it could be used to measure disease progression in these conditions and response to treatment.", "detailedDescription": "New diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of neurological disease are consistently sought after. In particular, identifying biomarkers which can diagnose a condition at an early or prodromal stage would identify a cohort of patients most likely to benefit from disease modifying treatments. Similarly, biomarkers which might serve as a surrogate of disease progression over time will be essential to monitor these patients' response to those treatments.\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is one progressive neurodegenerative condition for which many disease-modifying trials are currently in development. PD remains an entirely clinical diagnosis and no diagnostic tests for the condition currently exist. It must be distinguished from clinically similar conditions with different pathological substrates, namely the atypical parkinsonian disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) as each substrate will require tailored treatments. Differentiating PD from atypical parkinsonism can be challenging, particularly early in the disease course. The diagnostic accuracy among those with autopsy proven PD early in the disease course is as low as 26% and although this accuracy rises with disease duration, the pre-mortem diagnosis remains incorrect up to 15-20% of the time.\n\nMuch effort in recent years has focused on the development of molecular diagnostic biomarkers.However, whether these biomarkers can explain the heterogeneity we see among people with PD (PwP) and other parkinsonian disorders, and whether they are useful markers of disease progression remains unclear. Either way, clinically relevant biomarkers which can differentiate parkinsonian disorders at an early stage, predict disease trajectory and track clinical progression over time will clearly be required. The clinical measures most commonly used to track disease progression in clinical trials are rating scales such as the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). There are however concerns that these scales may not provide the precision necessary to detect small clinical changes, particularly in early PD. Before one can assess whether a clinical biomarker is useful longitudinally, their accuracy in a cross-sectional cohort must be assessed and, in particular, whether they are sensitive to the heterogeneity seen among the degenerative parkinsonian disorders. In addition, one must assess the effect, if any that symptomatic medications such as levodopa have on the performance of that biomarker. Quantitative assessment of eye movements may be a simple, reliable and sensitive clinical biomarker for PD and atypical parkinsonian disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) Indeed, eye movements have long been used at the bedside to localize pathology and to diagnose many movement disorders. Although clinically apparent oculomotor abnormalities are well documented in the advanced stages of these conditions, they may not be appreciable to the naked eye early in the disease course. The diagnosis of PSP, for example, relies heavily on the clinical assessment of eye movements - in particular the presence of limited vertical gaze. Although this is the classical eye movement abnormality seen in PSP, in the early stages of the disease, the only eye movement clue may be subtle slowing of vertical saccades or curvature of the arc of the saccadic eye movement. In a postmortem study of parkinsonian disorders, a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, when present, has a specificity of 91% for pathologically definite PSP, increasing to 97% when present within 3 years after disease onset. However, its sensitivity in heralding a PSP diagnosis is only 31% when detected within the first 3 years of disease.\n\nTo date, the application of quantitative oculomotor analysis to movement disorders has been limited, largely as a result of technological restrictions. As such, any information gleaned from eye movements in clinical practice is largely restricted to what can be detected by the naked eye at bedside assessment. Since quantitative assessment of eye movements will be more sensitive to these oculomotor abnormalities than bedside assessment with the naked eye, detection of these abnormalities will be possible at an earlier stage. Advances in technology have allowed eye tracking to become a simple, non-invasive, and effective way to assess eye movements, pupillary function and blink rate with high resolution. Quantitative oculomotor parameters (saccades and pupillary changes) correlate with motor performance, cognitive function and postural abnormalities in PwP. Given that these are crucial milestones in progression of PD, the investigators hypothesize that early assessment of subclinical oculomotor abnormalities will have prognostic value in PD and related conditions. However, only a few small studies have investigated whether quantitative assessment of eye movements can be used to differentiate PD from similar conditions such as PSP.\n\nRecently, pupillary dilatation has been shown to be a potential marker of goal-directed eye movement (specifically motor preparation when planning saccades), but these have not been explored in detail in PD. Given that PwP lose automaticity of movement in the early stages and can compensate with goal-directed attentional strategies, it is likely that early compensatory differences in these processes can be detected.\n\nNo study has examined whether such oculomotor parameters correlate with the heterogeneous clinical findings we see among PwP and related disorders.Similarly, no study has examined whether oculomotor assessment can act as an early diagnostic marker or as a longitudinal prognostic marker for these diseases.\n\nThe Munoz lab at Queen's University has extensive expertise in eye movement analysis. Recently, the Munoz lab have been able to identify a signature of eye movement parameters (specifically saccadic eye movements, pupillary responses and blink rate) which is present in people with PD but not in healthy controls. This signature is also present in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder, a condition which converts to PD or a similar disorder in up to 80% of people over 10-15 years. This implies that this signature can be detected at a very early (prodromal) stage in these conditions before the other clinical manifestations appear. Furthermore, the investigators have preliminary unpublished data to suggest that this signature may separate PwP from other neurodegenerative disorders such as PSP. The investigators aim to confirm that this novel eye movement signature can differentiate PD from its mimics in a large number of participants, and that it correlates with the heterogeneous disease-specific clinical features seen in these disorders.\n\nThe majority of the studies above involve structured tasks where the participant is advised to direct their gaze towards (or away from) a target when it appears. In this artificial setting, the eye movements recorded may not be an accurate reflection of a participates natural eye movement control. This study will also consist of a novel free-viewing task where participants are instructed to watch a number of brief video clips while the investigators record their eye movements and pupillary responses as they visually search these clips.This is akin to changing the television channel every few seconds and observing the initial automatic response (saccade and pupil) to a visual scene, followed by the slightly later cognitive influence of searching the video for content.\n\nHence, the investigators can analyze separately the bottom-up and top-down processes in parkinsonian disorders and hence separate brainstem-predominant pathology from cortical pathology with a simple eye movement paradigm. The Munoz lab has demonstrated the ability to extract these data parameters without requiring a structured experimental paradigm, allowing the investigators to collect eye movements in a much more ecological fashion.No other groups to date have measured these eye movements during free-viewing of video clips in Parkinson's disease or any other movement disorder. The investigators will explore whether the information gathered by this assessment of natural eye movements will allow us to diagnose and prognosticate patients with movement disorders.\n\nUltimately, this work aims to establish biomarkers for disease by linking eye tracking data with clinical diagnoses and outcomes."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonism", "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Corticobasal Degeneration"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 122, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Parkinson's disease", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Eye tracking using Eyelink 1000 during free-viewing of videos", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Free-viewing eye tracking"]}, {"label": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Eye tracking using Eyelink 1000 during free-viewing of videos", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Free-viewing eye tracking"]}, {"label": "Multiple System Atrophy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Eye tracking using Eyelink 1000 during free-viewing of videos", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Free-viewing eye tracking"]}, {"label": "Corticobasal Syndrome", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Eye tracking using Eyelink 1000 during free-viewing of videos", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Free-viewing eye tracking"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Free-viewing eye tracking", "description": "Participants will watch 20 minutes of video clips while their eye movements, pupil size and blink rate are recorded", "armGroupLabels": ["Corticobasal Syndrome", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Parkinson's disease", "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Amplitude of saccadic eye movements (in degrees) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "description": "Amplitude of saccadic eye movements (in degrees) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "timeFrame": "24 months"}, {"measure": "Pupil Constriction (in mm) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "description": "Pupil Constriction (in mm) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "timeFrame": "24 months"}, {"measure": "Blink Rate (blinks/second) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "description": "Blink rate (blinks/second) measured by eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "timeFrame": "24 months"}, {"measure": "Velocity of saccadic eye movements (in degrees/second) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "description": "Velocity of saccadic eye movements (in degrees/second) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "timeFrame": "24 months"}, {"measure": "Pupil dilatation (in mm) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "description": "Pupil dilatation (in mm) measured by Eyelink 1000 eye tracker during free viewing of videos.", "timeFrame": "24 months"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Attending or referred to the Movement Disorder Clinic at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital\n* Current diagnosis of PD, PSP, MSA, CBS.\n* Participant can give informed written consent.

The results will identify the extent of the gastric reflux problem in these patients and will enable appropriate medical treatment and modifications to physiotherapy, which may improve lung function and quality of life.", "detailedDescription": "Research plan:\n\nFifty-four subjects will be recruited from the Department of AIRMED outpatient clinics at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne. Subjects will be considered eligible if they have a diagnosis of COPD or bronchiectasis and are clinically stable.\n\nSubjects who give their consent will undergo the following measures:\n\n1. Demographic data including age, gender, BMI, prescribed medications at time of study.\n2. Structured symptom questionnaire A reliable, valid structured symptom questionnaire which will assess symptomatic GOR.\n3. Health -related quality of life and sleep quality Quality of life will be recorded using a Short form-36, St Georges's Respiratory Questionnaire and Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia questionnaire.\n4. Dual-channel 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring\n\nAmbulatory 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring will be undertaken by all subjects using dual-channel oesophageal pH monitoring equipment. The distal antimony-tipped probe will be sited 5cm above the upper portion of the lower oesophageal sphincter (distal sensor) with the proximal sensor sited 15cm above the distal sensor. The probe is attached to the digitrapper and will record oesophageal pH for 24 hours. The subject will be instructed to activate the digitrapper's three event buttons recording start and finish time of meals, supine versus upright posture and GOR symptoms. The following indices will be measured in the distal and proximal oesophagus:\n\n* number of reflux episodes,\n* % reflux time,\n* number of long episodes \\> 5 minutes,\n* duration of the longest episode\n* DeMeester score, a weighted overall score of gastro-oesophageal function.\n\nAll subjects will maintain a 24 hour diary recording meals, positions, medications and physiotherapy airway clearance sessions.\n\nDuring the 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring, the following interventions will be completed:\n\n1. Standard Spirometry. Measurement of spirometry will be performed according to the GINA guidelines.\n2. Pepsin Assay. Four sets of samples per subject of sputum and saliva for pepsin analysis will be collected during the study: at study commencement, during the airway clearance session, upon rising in the morning and post exercise testing. EnzChek Protease Assay kit will be used for analysis.\n3. Airway clearance techniques. Each subject with excessive secretions will perform PEP therapy, completing 8 cycles of 10 breaths, 2 forced expirations (huffs) and coughing using a PariPEP device.\n4. Exercise testing. Each subject will complete 2 x Six-Minute-Walk Tests and 3 x Grocery Shelving Tests according to the test protocols.\n5. Actigraphy. Each subject will wear a wrist actigraph on their dominant wrist which will record timing of activity and inactivity, so that sleep quality can be extrapolated. Subjects will also complete a Pittsburgh Sleep Diary during the study.\n\nOn study completion, subjects will return for removal of the oesophageal probe and retrieval of the digitrapper. Oesophageal pH study data will be downloaded onto a computer file for analysis. Oral intake, medications, symptoms, positioning, airway clearance and exercise will be extracted from subjective diaries that the subjects maintain, together with quality of life questionnaires and compared with pH recording data.

Previous studies have indicated that daily use of artificial tears over a two week period decreases the short term affect of drop application on aberrometry and contrast sensitivity measurements. The present study will examine the effects of 4 weeks of artificial tear use to determine when the responses stabilize.", "detailedDescription": "Dry eye patients experience symptoms such as; irritation, dryness, a scratchy sensation, and blur. These symptoms are the result of an insufficient tear layer. Blur can occur in dry eye patients because of an irregular tear film surface.\n\nArtificial tears are applied to the eye to treat a variety of eye conditions. These conditions typically are associated with dry eyes and include tear film deficiency due to ocular or systemic disease, lid resurfacing problems, and contact lens wear. The artificial tears are used to alleviate the dry eye symptoms.\n\nDry eye is a frequently encountered ocular condition. Recent studies estimate that 7.8% of women and 4.8% of men over the age of 50 suffer from dry eye. The administration of an artificial tear to the eye can disrupt the tear layer and this disruption could then result in a change in contrast sensitivity for a few moments. Aberrometry is a technique that is able to monitor tear layer disruption and its results may correlate with contrast sensitivity changes.\n\nTear layer disruption results in a decrease in the modulation transfer function (MTF) for the eye. Since the tear layer is the first refracting surface of the eye, its disruption can also result in a change in contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, and aberrometry. Previous work has demonstrated that higher order aberrations increase 1.44 fold after the tear film breaks up in normal subjects. Dry eye subjects demonstrate a significant increase in higher order aberrations (i.e., total S3+4+5, spherical-like S4, and coma-like S3+5) when compared to normal subjects. This has been interpreted to be the result of increased tear irregularities in the dry eye subjects.\n\nWhen an artificial tear (i.e., Vismed) was applied to the tear layer of dry eye subjects, the optical aberrations decreased. This previous study only examined the short term affect (less than 10 minutes) of a single administration of an artificial tear. In this study, we propose to examine the short and long term effects of a new emulsion on contrast sensitivity, optical aberrations, and reading ability after administration into the tear layer of normal and dry eye subjects."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dry Eye Syndrome"], "keywords": ["functional vision", "contrast sensitivity", "aberrometry", "reading ability"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "primaryPurpose": "BASIC_SCIENCE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 20, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Optive, Soothe, New Emulsion", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects do not use artificial tears for one week followed by 1 month using Optive two times per day.

The cellular stromal vascular fraction (cSVF) created is neutralized and rinsed to eliminate residual enzymatic molecules.\n\nThese cells are suspending in sterile Normal Saline Solution (500cc) and re-administered via an intravenous parenteral route, passed through a standard sterile 150 u (micron) filter in line.\n\nMultiple tracking and questionnaire followup is intended over a 5 year period, with objective and subjective criteria being met. Compilation and analysis of data to be completed after that period.", "detailedDescription": "Dementia refers to neurodegenerative conditions causing gradual decrease in ability to think and recall, to the point that is impacts daily functions. It is often accompanied by language difficulties, wide ranging emotional issues, loss of language skills, and lowering of activity motivation. These changes are often in the face of unchanged consciousness.\n\nMost common type is Alzheimer's Disease (50-70% of cas.es), but include vascular dementia (25%), Lewy Body dementia (15%) and frontotemporal dementia. There are many interrelated disorders that mask the underlying issues, such as in Parkinson's Disease, and whose diagnosis may overlap with the others.\n\nMost common symptoms include memory lapses, visual-spatial language changes, attention loss and problem solving difficulties. A wide variety of other symptoms may be seen, such as balance issues, tremors, difficulty swallowing, hallucinations, wandering, restlessness or agitation/depression, mood swings, etc..\n\nParkinson's Disease (PD) is a long-term neurodegenerative disorder of the Central Nervous System (CNS) that usually impacts the motor system, in a progressive and long-term fashion. Early signs include tremors, rigidity, slow movements and walking issues. It is often associated with thinking problems and depression, plus emotional states that impact daily living.\n\nThe causation of PD is felt to involve genetic predisposition and environmental factors. History of head injuries, chemical exposures, smokers, caffeine intake and other dietary issues. The motor symptoms seem to result from cellular death in the midbrain area (particularly the substantia nigra) and associated with inadequate dopamine. Plaques (protein build up following cellular death) may be a prominent feature, and use of neuroimaging (like MRI with/without contrast) is of value to track progressive changes in the brain.\n\nConventional therapy is use of L-DOPA and dopamine agonists and pharmaceutical agents have not proved of long-term reversal or arrest of the process. Evaluation of non-traditional methods are currently gaining popularity, especially in the area of stem/stromal cellular therapy.\n\nCNS Autoimmune Demyelination is group of disorders of the CNS which feature loss of myelin from unknown causes but include variants of encephalomyelitis, cerebral sclerosis of Schilder, multiple sclerosis, and idiopathic inflammatory demyelination.\n\nIn cases involving myelin sheath of neurons is damaged, reducing the conduction of nerve signals causing loss of sensory, motor, cognitive abilities, and a wide variety of functions dependent on actual location of changes.\n\nThere is strong evidence that autoimmune, infectious agents, and chemical reactions may contribute to the evolution of the disease complex. In cases of multiple sclerosis, it appears that T-cells and macrophages, and mast cells may be present in the CNS plaques that are characteristically seen in areas of the ventricles and scattered areas of the brain. These are typically identified and tracked by MRI studies.\n\nTraditional pharmaceutical approaches have proven to be of little advantage in reversing or completely stopping the disease processes. Many side effects and reactions, or loss of drug effectiveness have led researchers to explore use of stem/stromal cells with their effects on immunomodulation and inflammatory modulation effects. Early trials suggest that these may be able to actually reverse visible lesions and improve quality of function and life, with reported improvement in neurological conditions.\n\nManagement of symptoms is often accompanied by lifestyle changes, rest periods, physical and mental rehabilitations, diet, chelation and hyper-vitamin infusions, and a number of antioxidant therapies. The progressive phases seem to include the innate immune system, and is felt to explain the potential value of use of autologous stem/stromal cellular groups, particularly involving the mesenchymal and pericytic/endothelial cellular groups.\n\nSensorimotor demyelination neuropathies (HMSN) is group of neuropathies characterized by impact on afferent and efferent neural communications. They feature atypical neural development and degradation of nerve tissues.\n\nTwo common forms of HMSN are either hypertrophic demyelinated nerves or atrophy of nerve (peripheral) and neural tissues. Hypertrophy is featured by neural stiffness rather than demyelination of peripheral nerves. Whereas atrophy causes loss of axons and neural cell bodies. They often experience progressive muscle atrophy and sensory neuropathy of the extremities. The term \"hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy has been commonly referred to a forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT). There are distinct genetic and phenotypically distinct forms of CMT, and the term of HMSN is less frequently used.\n\nUsual onset is childhood or young adulthood, with motor involvement more prominent that sensory. Often mistaken for causalgia or fibromyalgia, the symptoms of fatigue, pain, balance loss, areflexia, visual changes, foot drop and scoliosis. As in the causalgia or Sympathetic Reflex Dystrophy (SRD), these patients are treated according to symptoms, with medication and traditional interventions proving of limited benefit. Some preliminary findings using the modulatory action of stem/stromal cells suggest some help with the symptomatology, particularly relative fatigue and pain.\n\nHuntington's Disease is an inherited disorder resulting in death of brain cells. A gradual change in mood or mental abilities, is followed by unsteady gait, jerky body movements, leading to speech loss or severe depression. Although associated with heredity or mutation, pharmaceuticals and stem/stromal cell therapy are felt to offer some assistance in maintaining quality of life (Qol).\n\nThe huntington protein (HP) is poorly understood, but believe toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Damage is most noticed in the striatum of the brain. The changes associated with the HP relate to the cell transcription, cell signaling and intracellular transport.\n\nMost prominent changes are within the basal ganglia (neostriatum) and includes the caudate nucleus and putamen. Substantia nigra and cerebellum seem particularly impacted. Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy have been used in conjunction with trials using autologous stem/stromal cellular therapies are offering some slowing of the processes.\n\nMedications have been developed, but remain modestly effective and possessing major side effects and poorly tolerated. Most of the pharmaceutical approaches have not proven effective in reversal of the disease, many accepting a slowing or remission induction without inducing the body ability to provide any regenerative effects. Dietary controls, use of mind exercising, hyperoxygenation protocols, chelation, vitamin infusions, etc. have proven to be helpful adjunctive therapies. Alternative treatments, including physical therapy and some stem/stromal therapies have become more common.\n\nThree main characteristics of the neurodegenerative group are: 1). Lesion formations in the central nervous system (called Plaques); 2). Inflammation; 3). Demyelination and Destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. This demyelination is thought to stimulate the inflammatory processes due to action of a lymphocyte group known at T-cell which seems to recognize patient's own myelin as foreign and proceeds to attack it (known as \"autoreactive lymphocytes\"). These findings are often concluded to represent an autoimmune response to one's own tissues. The inherent properties of modulation and inflammatory modulation make potential uses of autologous reparative group of cells located throughout the body in association with microcapillary structures in essentially every tissue in the body. These cells have been identified by cell surface markers and studied in tissue culture to have \"multipotent\" capabilities that potentially participate in the regenerative processes to help arrest or improve the autoimmune group of disorders.\n\nTraditionally, exacerbation's are often treated with high dose intravenous steroids which may be of short term reduction of symptoms, not addressing the underlying causation. Current medications available for treatment are expensive an fraught with major side effects, making their use very difficult and producing limited measured value.\n\nWith the advent of convenient ability to acquire significant numbers of alive (viable) an easily gathered by harvesting from microvascular stores in the body (adipose tissue complex). Technological advances in sterile, closed processing, has provided the ability to easily and safely acquire significant of stem/stromal cells for use in clinical studies.\n\nThis study is aimed at evaluation of the safety profile (adverse reactions \\& severe adverse reactions) of the closed syringe, microcannula harvesting of subdermal fat deposits (largest known source of microvascular tissues in the body). This autologous cell group obtained with isolation and concentration of cells within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) via enzymatic digestion, and deployed via intravascular r rebral fluids in defects of the blood brain barrier (BBB) or are small enough to pass into the fluids of the CNS (central nervous system). Effects are believed to be a function of both cellular multipotent abilities, but also regards the autocrine/paracrine secretory capacity of the cell group within the body. The body has the ability to request (chemotaxis) certain needed cellular and secreted chemicals to help healing and regeneration. Current thought are trending that the secretions may, in fact, be more important to the reparative and regenerative processes than the cellular contributions.\n\nIn this study, disorders which involve autoimmune and inflammatory changes that impact the brain and nervous system are to be study, tracked and reported over time to determine ultimate efficacy and the \"interval\" therapy needs (or lack thereof) to maintain the accomplished arrest or improvement in the underlying tissues. Currently these intervals are examined by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast. Correlation of image changes and clinical function will be made with subjective Quality of Life (Qol) and diary type observations by patients and caregivers."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions":

Cuffed tubes have traditionally been recommended for children older than 8 to 10 years. During the past decade, however, several authors have argued for the use of cuffed tracheal tubes in younger children and infants. A frequently cited argument against their use is the fear from post-extubation morbidity, allegedly caused by cuff induced tracheal and laryngeal airway injury. Using modern improved designed cuffed tracheal tubes, data from randomised prospective studies, performed in paediatric anaesthesia and intensive care units, suggest that using cuffed tracheal tubes do not carry an increased risk for airway morbidity as compared to uncuffed tracheal tubes in children below 8 years of age if correctly used. However, all these studies are based on single-centre experiences and/or included only a few neonates, infants and small children. Hence, there is equipoise as to the question, whether cuffed tubes are preferable over uncuffed standard tubes.\n\nSo, this randomized controlled multi-centre trial in children from birth up to \\< 5 years of age aims to demonstrate equivalence as to the major outcome of post-extubation airway injury (stridor) comparing uncuffed tracheal tubes to current tracheal tubes with modern high volume - low pressure cuff combined with a cuff pressure release valve.\n\nThe primary hypothesis relates to the main outcome criteria of this study, which is post-extubation morbidity as measured by the presence or absence of stridor after tracheal extubation. The null-hypothesis Ho is defined as no difference in the incidence rates of post-extubation morbidity between cuffed and uncuffed groups. The null-hypothesis (Ho: u-Diff = 0) will be compared with the alternative hypothesis (H1: u-Diff \\<\\> 0). The study is designed to detect a clinically unacceptable deterioration of 1.5% above the baseline airway-injury rate of 2.5% when using uncuffed tubes with a power of 90% and a type I error probability of less than 5%."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Need for Tracheal Tube Exchange", "Presence of Post-extubation Laryngeal Oedema"], "keywords": ["intubation", "trachea", "tube", "cuff", "children"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 4000, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Intubation using tracheal tubes with or without cuff"}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "post-extubation stridor (airway stenosis)"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Children aged from birth (weighing \\> 3 kg) to \\<5 years\n* Children requiring oro-tracheal or naso-tracheal intubation with a Magil shaped tracheal tube or preformed (RAE) tracheal tube as a part of their anaesthetic care and planed IPPV during the surgical / interventional / diagnostic procedure\n* Tracheal intubation performed using direct laryngoscopy\n* Extubation after the procedure in the OR theatre\n* Procedure performed in supine position\n* Patients for elective and emergency surgery and/or interventions if there is no risk for regurgitation or pulmonary aspiration\n* ASA I and II patients\n* Written parental consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No parental written consent obtained\n* Known airway anomalies (airway stenosis, including Down's Syndrome)\n* Known or suspected difficult intubation\n* Known need for abnormal tube size\n* Full stomach and/or at risk for regurgitation\n* Surgery of the larynx and/or of the trachea and/or neck and/or upper oesophagus\n* Pulmonary diseases (concurrent pneumonia or bronchial infection, asthma requiring inhalation medication, pulmonary malformations)\n* ASA class III and higher\n* Fiberoptic intubation or alternative intubation technique\n* Patients planned for postoperative ventilation in the ICU\n* Weight and/or height percentiles \\< 3% / \\> 97%", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "1 Day", "maximumAge": "5 Years", "stdAges": ["CHILD"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"overallOfficials": [{"name": "Markus Weiss, Prof MD", "affiliation": "University Children's Hospital, Anesthesiology", "role": "PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}], "locations": [{"facility": "Anesthesia And Critical Care Medicine - Medical University", "city": "Innsbruck", "country": "Austria", "geoPoint": {"lat": 47.26266, "lon": 11.39454}}, {"facility": "Departement of Anaesthesia - Cliniques Universitaire St. Luc", "city": "Brussels", "country": "Belgium", "geoPoint": {"lat": 50.85045, "lon": 4.34878}}, {"facility": "Dept. of Anaesthesia and Reanimation - University Hospital Motol", "city": "Prague", "country": "Czechia", "geoPoint": {"lat": 50.08804, "lon": 14.42076}}, {"facility": "Klinik f\u00fcr Anasthesiologie und Operative Intensivmedizin - Klinikum Augsburg", "city": "Augsburg", "country": "Germany", "geoPoint": {"lat": 48.37154, "lon": 10.89851}}, {"facility": "Clinic of Anesthesiology - Charite-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin", "city": "Berlin", "country": "Germany", "geoPoint": {"lat": 52.52437, "lon": 13.41053}}, {"facility": "Dep.

The contact between clients and therapists takes place exclusively via Internet. The therapists follow a scientifically tested treatment protocol, that defines fixed treatment elements that are adapted to the specific situation of the client. The participants can write at home, in their familiar environment which makes it easier to work on trauma related issues with their therapist. In the last years the treatment was offered in Arabic as well indicating to be an effective treatment for PTSD in Arabic-speaking countries.\n\nMethod:\n\nTraumatized Arabic-speaking participants are allocated at random to a long version (10 sessions) of a manualized writing approach over 6 weeks or to a short version, where the part concerning the cognitive restructuring is excluded. The investigators expect the treatment to be useful for traumatized clients, especially for those who have no access to psychological help otherwise and they hypothesize that both interventions will significantly improve clinical symptoms of PTSD. Furthermore, the investigators expect improvements in secondary outcomes such as anxiety, depression and quality of life. Additionally the investigators are interested, if the short form where the cognitive part is excluded and the focus will be more on confrontation is effective similarly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf the interventions prove to be an effective treatment for PTSD in Arabic-speaking countries, the results will lend to support to the establishment of internet-based approaches, especially in countries, where face-to-face therapy cannot be provided. Furthermore a shorter treatment could improve the compliance of the participants, particularly in post-conflict regions where people cannot attend long therapeutic interventions."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)"], "keywords": ["posttraumatic stress disorder", "internet-based psychotherapy", "cognitive restructuring", "exposure"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 293, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Treatment of PTSD with cognitive restructuring", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "In this arm the PTSD treatment can be divided into three phases.\n\nFirst phase: self-confrontation (4 essays)\n\nSecond phase: cognitive restructuring (4 essays)\n\nThird phase: parting (2 essays)", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Exposure for PTSD with cognitive restructuring"]}, {"label": "Treatment of PTSD without cognitive restructuring", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "In this arm the PTSD treatment can be divided into only two phases.

Reliable identification of ineffective therapies can eliminate needless human suffering while increasing overall probability of positive response to treatment. Chemotherapy resistance profiling entails testing whether a patient exhibits strong resistance to a therapy prior to its final selection by the oncologist. However, there are no effective methods for quickly assessing patient chemotherapy resistance. Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models have replaced older Chemotherapy Sensitivity and Resistance Assays (CSRAs) to some degree, but both technologies suffer from long testing times, high cost, and/or low accuracy.\n\nMotility Contrast Tomography (MCT) has recently emerged as a technology that measures the biodynamic response of intact tumor biopsies to applied therapeutics by using Doppler detection of infrared light scattered from intracellular motions inside living tissue. Several small scale animal, xenograft, and human studies have shown this phenotypic profiling technique to be highly accurate in prediction of response and resistance to chemotherapy. This project will be the first human trial of biodynamic phenotyping to predict chemotherapy response among bladder cancer patients. Specifically, the study cohort will include patients selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, because this setting offers the opportunity for near-term outcome measurement at the time of post-chemo surgery. Pre-therapy fresh tumor specimens will be imaged using MCT, and the resulting bio-dynamic signatures will be compared to confirmed pathological response at the time of surgery. Observation of a high predictive value will provide the basis for expanded clinical trials and prompt commercialization of a biodynamic chemotherapy selection assay for bladder and other cancer patients.", "detailedDescription": "STUDY RATIONALE: The demonstrated ability of MCT to accurately assess tumor xenografts may establish it as a reliable technique for patient tumor stratification based on predicted response to therapy, which could enable a treatment selection based on the personal needs of an individual patient. This study is designed to assess MCT as an assay for predicting chemosensitivity to treatment with chemotherapy agents routinely used in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of bladder cancer. If positive, the results of this study will provide the basis for expanded clinical trials and use of MCT in therapy selection.\n\nBACKGROUND: Live cell imaging has become the standard for high-content analysis and drug discovery applications. The most common assays on live cells include viability, proliferation and cytotoxicity assays as cellular physiology and function are measured responding to applied perturbations of xenobiotics. Cellular and tissue viability assays are typically measured using exogenous vital dyes as biomarkers of membrane integrity or cellular metabolic activity. However, dyes are invasive, potentially toxic, and often require fixing of the tissue or permeabilization of the membranes. Furthermore, the common format of high content analysis and flow cytometry requires isolated cells, or cells distributed on flat hard surfaces. Isolated cells lack many of the biologically-relevant intercellular connections and communications that are hallmarks of healthy tissue, and flattened cells on plates have pathological shapes and anisotropic cellular adhesions.\n\nDiscovery of technology that can predict response to cancer therapy is an urgent priority. While many technologies exist to evaluate early response to drugs ex vivo, the need to perform viability, cytotoxicity and proliferation assays in three-dimensional tissue or culture has become increasingly urgent, as drug response in 2D is often not the same as drug response in biologically-relevant three dimensional culture. This is in part because genomic profiles are not preserved in monolayer cultures. There have been several studies that have tracked the expression of genes associated with cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and resistance to therapy that are expressed differently in 2D cultures relative to three-dimensional culture. For example, cell lines of epithelial ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, or colon cancer display expression profiles more like those from tumor tissues when measured in three-dimensional culture, but not when grown in 2D. In addition, the three-dimensional environment of 3D culture presents different pharmacokinetics than 2D monolayer culture and produce differences in cancer drug sensitivities. Finally, most current technologies rely on destructive end-point assessment, preventing meaningful longitudinal observation of therapy response over time.\n\nOne of the main challenges to migrating drug-response assays to the third and fourth dimensions has been to find a means to extract vital information from deep (up to a millimeter) inside living tissue. Tissue is translucent and light can propagate diffusively many centimeters. Furthermore, the dynamic motions of living cells cause dynamic light scattering that produces phase fluctuations on the scattered light fields that can be measured as dynamic speckle in diffusely reflected light from tissue. This is the basis of diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) and diffusion correlation spectroscopy (DCS), but these techniques lack depth resolution. A powerful tool in the characterization of light propagation in tissues is the use of interferometry. Interferometric detection is the underlying process in optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is a point-scanning technique that suppresses speckle, although speckle decorrelation in OCT data can provide similar information as provided by DCS. This has been used to measure intracellular rheology and to find dynamic signatures of apoptosis. Transport also can be detected at cellular resolution using phase contrast microscopy, but this approach cannot be used in thick tissues.\n\nDr. Nolte and colleagues have developed volumetrically-resolved tissue dynamic imaging that uses the advantages of depth selectivity from low-coherence interferometry, combined with high speckle contrast in broad-illumination digital holography. The technique is called Motility Contrast Tomography (MCT) and uses low-coherence digital holography to penetrate up to 1 millimeter into living tissue to measure speckle dynamics from light scattering from dynamic motion in living cells. It was previously applied as a cytotoxicity assay to study the efficacy of anti-mitotic drugs. In essence, the technology works by profiling the 'movement' of cellular organelles. Specific changes in organelle motion are detectable very early in cells undergoing response to chemotherapy treatment, and may be usable as an early predictor of chemotherapy response.\n\nMCT is based on optical coherence imaging (OCI). OCI is a full-field short-coherence holography that collects backscattered speckle. With the help of coherence gating, OCI can optically section tissue up to 1 mm deep. MCT specifically uses intracellular motion as the endogenous contrast to characterize submicron subcellular motion inside three-dimensional living tissue.\n\nEX VIVO CANCER CHEMOSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MCT was previously applied to study the efficacy of anti-mitotic drugs using multicellular tumor spheroids. When applying MCT to tumor xenografts, it is also capable of showing a significantly different response between two cell lines under cisplatin. After applying the drug, the normalized standard deviation (NSD) value of the platinum-sensitive cell line (A2780) drops from 0.7 to 0.1 in 8 hours. In contrast, the NSD value of the platinum-resistant cell line (A2780-CP70) remains nearly constant (0.81 to 0.80) 9 hours after applying drug. The NSD value of normal mouse tissue attached to the tumor xenograft decreases only a little (0.6 to 0.52) compared with A2780.\n\nIn a further study in a veterinary clinical setting, MCT has been used to predict patient outcome for canine non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Canine non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are initially characterized by tumoral infiltration of peripheral lymph nodes. Canine non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are diverse in their clinical aggressiveness and response to chemotherapy. The only current biomarker for chemoresponsiveness is tumor cell immunophenotype (i.e. T-cell vs. B-cell origin), but chemoresponsiveness varies tremendously within immunophenotype, which reduces the clinical utility of this biomarker. In our study, we used MCT to measure the heterogeneous response of canine lymphoma biopsies to the standard-of-care doxorubicin. The biodynamic signatures of doxorubicin responsivity ex vivo were correlated with canine patient outcome. These studies have demonstrated, for the first time, the utility of label-free intracellular biodynamic markers to predict therapeutic efficacy for cancer treatment in dogs.\n\nSPECIFIC AIMS The primary study objective is to examine the feasibility of using MCT as a chemosensitivity assay among bladder cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy by comparing MCT patterns consistent with chemotherapy response or resistance ex-vivo to confirmed response or resistance to chemotherapy as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria.\n\nPRIMARY ENDPOINT: Objective pathological response measured at the time of surgery."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Bladder Cancer"], "keywords": ["Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "COHORT", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 150, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DIAGNOSTIC_TEST", "name": "Onco4D Biodynamic Chemotherapy Selection Assay", "description": "The Onco4D Biodynamic Chemotherapy Selection Assay uses Motility Contrast Tomography (MCT) to measure ex-vivo fresh tumor biopsy response when challenged by an array of chemotherapeutic agents.

As with the first two stages, this study will examine whether entrainment of 40 Hz neural oscillation by novel 40 Hz Invisible Spectral Flicker is a potential therapy for Alzheimer's Disease. In order to examine this, 62 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease will be recruited. The patients will be exposed to the Non-Invasive Light Therapy System for 1 hour a day for 6 months. The effect will be measured by a combination of electroencephalography, cognitive testing, functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and actigraphy.", "detailedDescription": "Recent studies in mouse models of Alzhimer's Disease (AD) have shown that exposure to 40 Hz stroboscopic light therapy for one hour a day, resulted in slowing disease progression and lead to multiple neuroprotective effects such as cognition and memory recovery, and even scavenged both tau and A\u03b2 protein species. Hence, the 40 Hz stroboscopic light therapy has a considerable potential for treatment of humans.\n\nThis study will utilize a novel way of masked light by alternating the spectral composition of a white light, rendering the flicker invisible to the conscience perception, while still entraining 40 Hz oscillations in the brain.\n\nIn the study, 62 patients with probable mild to moderate AD will be exposed to either invisible spectral flickering light through the Light Therapy System (LTS) (active setting) or continuous non-flickering white light (sham setting) for 1 hour each day. The sham setting is a high quality sham intervention as subjects will be blinded to the setting, both appear as white light.\n\nThe study will last 8\u00bd months for each participant and consist of 3 periods: Enrollment period of 1 month, an intervention period of 6 months, and a 1\u00bd month post-interventional follow-up period.\n\nIn order to test whether the LTS intervention is a potential treatment for AD, cognition will be measured by neuropsychological tests at baseline and at follow-ups. To get a better understanding of the potential effects, markers of efficacy based on MRI, MRS, EEG and blood samples will be tested.\n\nThe results from this study will increase the understanding of the impact of gamma oscillations in the human brain, and how it can be utilized as a novel and important tool for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Alzheimer's Disease"], "keywords": ["Gamma Entrainment", "40 Hz", "Invisible Spectral Flicker", "LED", "Light Therapy", "Brain Stimulation", "Gamma Oscillations", "Gamma Induction"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "A parallel-group randomized (1:1), double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "TRIPLE", "maskingDescription": "Double-blinded", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 62, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Active", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Exposure to LTS device set to 40 Hz invisible spectral flicker for 1 hour a day for consecutive days", "interventionNames": ["Device: Light Therapy System (LTS): Active Setting"]}, {"label": "Sham", "type": "SHAM_COMPARATOR", "description": "Exposure to LTS device set to continuous color matched white light for 1 hour a day for consecutive days", "interventionNames": ["Device: Light Therapy System (LTS): Sham Setting"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Light Therapy System (LTS): Active Setting", "description": "Exposure for 1 hour \u00e1 day for consecutive days", "armGroupLabels": ["Active"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Light Therapy System (LTS): Sham Setting", "description": "Exposure for 1 hour \u00e1 day for consecutive days", "armGroupLabels": ["Sham"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Gamma oscillations assessment", "description": "Determine the total gamma power at 40 Hz, with no concomitant LTS device stimulation, assess changes in the gamma power at 40 Hz.", "timeFrame": "Change from Baseline to 6 months and 7.5 months"}, {"measure": "Induction of 40 Hz Gamma oscillations", "description": "Estimate the change in electrical field patterns by EEG SSVEP, assess the difference between placebo and treatment for power spectral density signal to noise ratio at baseline measured by EEG SSVEP", "timeFrame": "Change from Baseline to 6 months and 7.5 months"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Cognition and memory assessment", "description": "Assess changes in cognition measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale plus Executive Functioning and Functional Ability (ADAS Cog plus EF \\& FA).

Although these tumors are rare, their study is important because of the high death rates in afflicted patients, rivaling that of pancreatic cancer. Surgical resection offers the only current hope for long-term survival, averaging only 20% in major series1. The reality is such that for the majority of patients, CCA is a diagnosis of despair.\n\nAlthough surgery has offered the only hope of cure, one of the major limiting factors in achieving long-term survival following surgical resection of CCA is the technical ability to achieve negative resection margins. The presence of malignant cells at the surgical margins following resection is a major prognostic factor predicting recurrence and death. Theoretically, the likelihood of achieving negative margins can be increased with total hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Previous experience with OLT performed in isolation for hilar CCA's has been discouraging with dismal survival rates. However, a recent report has demonstrated that long-term survival can occur in carefully selected patients by combining the benefits of radiotherapy, chemosensitization, and OLT. With this strategy, patients survival rates of 92%, 82%, and 82% at 1, 3, and 5 years after transplantation have been achieved. It is not clear that these preliminary results can be confirmed at other centers, nor is it clear what selection criteria should optimally be used for this treatment strategy.\n\nOur hypothesis is that select patients undergoing liver transplantation for CCA in the context of multi-modality neoadjuvant therapy exhibit survival equivalent to other established indications for liver transplantation as previously demonstrated. We will also attempt to extend previously published criteria for liver transplantation in the setting of CCA by offering this protocol to patients with evidence of intrahepatic disease and regional nodal disease. Patients undergoing transplantation for CCA will be followed longitudinally for their entire post-transplant course and compared with a matched cohort of liver transplant recipients in regard to post-transplant survival, survival on the waiting list, as well as complications pre-and post-transplantation. Explanted livers will be examined for the presence of residual tumor.\n\nData will be collected on the rate of regional lymph node metastasis, invasion of adjacent organs and tissues, and the rate of peritoneal metastases. The rate of tumor recurrence, site, and time to recurrence will also be assessed.", "detailedDescription": "Objectives Specific Aim #1: Determine whether results obtained in select patients with American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System Stage I or II CCA are transferable to select patients with T3 or N1 disease.\n\nSpecific Aim #2: To determine whether success achieved with the only published protocol currently in use is directly transferable to the University of Utah's liver transplant program.\n\nLiver Transplant Protocol:\n\nThe surgical protocol will initially be offered to liver transplant candidates with de novo hilar CCA or CCA arising in the setting of PSC. Diagnosis of CCA will be established by intraluminal brush cytology, intraluminal biopsy, or a carcinoma antigen (CA) 19.9 level greater than 100 ng / mL in the setting of a radiographic malignant stricture. Biliary aneuploidy demonstrated with DIA and FISH will be considered equivalent to cytology.\n\nAll patients with CCA will be evaluated by the liver transplant team which includes experienced hepatobiliary and liver transplant surgeons. Patients will be presented at the weekly liver transplant selection conference to assess their candidacy as well as the weekly GI Multidisciplinary Tumor Conference at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. Clinical staging prior to neoadjuvant therapy will include chest and abdominal computed tomography, liver ultrasound, and bone scan.

Exclusion criteria will include previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, uncontrolled infection, a previous malignance other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer within the last five years, medical conditions precluding transplantation, metastatic disease (including N2 disease), and patients with hilar tumors extending below the cystic duct.\n\nAll patients will undergo staging laparoscopy to rule out the presence of peritoneal disease followed by staging laparotomy. Patients with extrahepatic metastases, local spread of disease to adjacent organs, and N2 nodal disease (metastasis to peripancreatic, periduodenal, periportal, celiac, superior mesenteric, and / or posterior pancreaticoduodenal nodes) will be excluded as will patients with extension of tumor into the main portal vein.

This may mean that they are less likely to survive than if the worsening of their illness had been picked up sooner. One reason for this may be that hospital staff are unable to check patients' vital signs (such as breathing rate, heart rate and level of oxygen in their blood) frequently enough to help them decide if a patient is becoming more unwell. Currently, for nurses to watch these vital signs closely, patients are either attached to a static machine by the patient's bedside using wires, or staff visit the patient every few hours to measure these vital signs using a portable wired machine. It is now possible to closely monitor patients using small devices which attach to the wrist, finger or chest. These devices allow nursing staff to continually watch vital signs data from these patients when they are away from their bedside. These machines are also wireless and portable, so they do not stop patients moving around, which is important for recovery, and are comfortable to wear. In past years, the investigators have tested these devices and developed a system to allow the clinical staff to see the continuous vital signs. In this final stage of the project, the investigators will test this system (with the selected devices) on patients in hospital. The investigators will start by doing a small trial on one surgical ward, and asking for staff and patient feedback of how the system worked, how useful it was, and how easy to use. If the feedback from this first small trial is positive, the investigators will conduct a future trial in several hospitals, to test how useful the system is in improving patient recovery.", "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of ambulatory monitoring systems (AMS) integration (with active clinical alerts) versus standard care in deterioration detection.\n\nSecondary objectives include other deterioration detection and clinical outcomes, trial progression outcomes, staff impact and alerting system performance, overall system reliability and patient experience.\n\nThis study is a superiority feasibility randomised controlled trial with two-arm parallel groups and 1:1 allocation ratio to compare the use of an ambulatory monitoring system with standard care in hospitalised patients. This feasibility trial will be conducted not only to assess the impact of AMS on early deterioration detection and other clinical outcomes but also to explore recruitment rate, calculate required sample size, number of sites and recruitment period for a full definitive RCT.\n\nParticipants will be recruited in one or more surgical wards inside Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (to be decided during feasibility trial, dependant on recruitment rate). Patients will be screened, recruited and participate in this study throughout their hospital stay, no follow-up visits will be required.\n\nThe intervention consists in the use of AMS that also includes an alerting system. Participants will wear one pulse oximeter (WristOx2 3150 OEM BLE, shorted to \"Nonin\", hereafter) measuring pulse rate (PR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2), one chest patch (VitalPatch) that will continuously measure their heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature,; and one A\\&D UA-1200 BLE Blood Pressure device, intermittently measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. Clinical staff will be able to access and interact with real-time vital signs through a dashboard style display and will be alerted via a hand-held device, and/or dashboard, according to the patient's EWS score.\n\nThe control group will also be fitted with these devices. However, clinical staff will not be able to access the dashboard display or receive alerts.\n\nThe trial will include a calibration period inside a surgical unit were the investigators will refine out alerting system. During this period the investigaotors will optimise our alerts through continuous analysis and feedback from the relevant clinical teams. Randomisation will still be conducted during this period.\n\nThis feasibility trial will be conducted in surgical units at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust. This will:\n\n* Assess the feasibility of a definitive RCT\n* Support sample size calculation for full study\n* Assess recruitment rate and the need for inclusion of more wards inside OUH.Staff focus groups or interviews will be held to gather feedback on the system which may inform further refinements, including usability, perceived effect on workload and appropriateness of alerts.\n* Multi-professionals staff interviews with be held to assess staff perception of the acceptability of the system in clinical practice.

To unravel the importance of molecular phenotyping in predicting the response to antimicrobial therapy with potential anti-inflammatory potency\n\nThe investigators have developed a non-invasive technique based on mRNA analysis of induced sputum that enables us to study airway inflammation in detail. This technique forms the basis for our current project based on the following hypotheses:\n\n1. Different molecular asthma phenotypes exist: a Th2 phenotype and a non Th2 phenotype as reported by Woodruff and colleagues (Woodruff PG et al).

As the classic first-line treatment, the emergence of the R-CHOP program has resulted in clinical cures for more than 1/2 of patients with B-cell lymphoma. But for patients with highly aggressively B cell lymphoma, most of them still suffer from disease recurrences due to R-CHOP treatment alone.\n\nIn recent years, with the emergence of various new drugs, many researchers have tried to add new drugs to the classic R-CHOP program as a first-line treatment for non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. As a new type of immunomodulator, lenalidomide was first approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In recent years, its role in refractory and relapsed B-cell lymphoma has gradually been recognized.\n\nIn 2015, Nowakowski et al. published a clinical study of 64 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who used R2-CHOP in first-line therapy. It was found that R2-CHOP does not improve R-CHOP in patients with GCB. The effective rate of treatment and the 2-year survival rate of patients, but for patients with non-GCB type DLBCL with poor prognosis, the addition of lenalidomide can greatly improve the remission rate of the disease and improve the poor prognosis of patients.\n\nSo, the investigators initiate this study to evaluate the efficacy of R2-CHOP/R2-EPOCH etc in newly diagnosed highly invasively non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Lymphoma, B-Cell"], "keywords": ["Lenalidomide\uff0crituximab\uff0cchemotherapy\uff0chighly aggressive B-NHL"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 200, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "R2-combination chemotherapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "R2-CHOP/CHOPE/DA-EPOCH/HD MTX\n\nR2-CHOP :\n\nlenalidomide 25mg/d po D1-10; Rituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Cyclophosphamide 750mg / m2 d1, doxorubicin 70mg / m2 or Doxorubicin liposome 30-40 mg / m2 d2, vincristine 1.4mg / m2 or vindesine 3mg / m2 d2, prednisone 100mg d1-5\n\nR2-DA-EPOCH:\n\nlenalidomide 25mg/d po D1-10; Rituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Epirubicin 15mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Etoposide 50mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Vincristine 0.4mg/ \uff4d\uff12 \uff0cd1-4; Cyclophosphamide 750mg/ \uff4d\uff12 , d\uff15; Prednisone 60mg/m\uff12/d, d1-5;\n\nR2-HD MTX:\n\nlenalidomide 25mg/d po D1-10; Rituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0\uff1b MTX 3.5g\uff0f\uff4d\uff12,\uff441", "interventionNames": ["Drug: R2-combination chemotherapy"]}, {"label": "R-combination chemotherapy", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "R-CHOP/CHOPE/DA-EPOCH/HD MTX\n\nR-CHOP :\n\nRituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Cyclophosphamide 750mg / m2 d1, doxorubicin 70mg / m2 or Doxorubicin liposome 30-40 mg / m2 d2, vincristine 1.4mg / m2 or vindesine 3mg / m2 d2, prednisone 100mg d1-5\n\nR-DA-EPOCH:\n\nRituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Epirubicin 15mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Etoposide 50mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Vincristine 0.4mg/ \uff4d\uff12 \uff0cd1-4; Cyclophosphamide 750mg/ \uff4d\uff12 , d\uff15; Prednisone 60mg/m\uff12/d, d1-5;\n\nR-HD MTX:\n\nRituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0\uff1b MTX 3.5g\uff0f\uff4d\uff12,\uff441", "interventionNames": ["Drug: R-combination chemotherapy"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "R2-combination chemotherapy", "description": "R2-CHOP/CHOPE/DA-EPOCH/HD MTX\n\nR2-CHOP :\n\nlenalidomide 25mg/d po D1-10; Rituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Cyclophosphamide 750mg / m2 d1, doxorubicin 70mg / m2 or Doxorubicin liposome 30-40 mg / m2 d2, vincristine 1.4mg / m2 or vindesine 3mg / m2 d2, prednisone 100mg d1-5\n\nR2-DA-EPOCH:\n\nlenalidomide 25mg/d po D1-10; Rituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Epirubicin 15mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Etoposide 50mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Vincristine 0.4mg/ \uff4d\uff12 \uff0cd1-4; Cyclophosphamide 750mg/ \uff4d\uff12 , d\uff15; Prednisone 60mg/m\uff12/d, d1-5;\n\nR2-HD MTX:\n\nlenalidomide 25mg/d po D1-10; Rituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0\uff1b MTX 3.5g\uff0f\uff4d\uff12,\uff441", "armGroupLabels": ["R2-combination chemotherapy"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "R-combination chemotherapy", "description": "R-CHOP/CHOPE/DA-EPOCH/HD MTX\n\nR-CHOP :\n\nRituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Cyclophosphamide 750mg / m2 d1, doxorubicin 70mg / m2 or Doxorubicin liposome 30-40 mg / m2 d2, vincristine 1.4mg / m2 or vindesine 3mg / m2 d2, prednisone 100mg d1-5\n\nR-DA-EPOCH:\n\nRituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0 Epirubicin 15mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Etoposide 50mg\uff0fm\uff12 ,d1-4; Vincristine 0.4mg/ \uff4d\uff12 \uff0cd1-4; Cyclophosphamide 750mg/ \uff4d\uff12 , d\uff15; Prednisone 60mg/m\uff12/d, d1-5;\n\nR-HD MTX:\n\nRituximab\uff1a375mg/m2\uff0civgtt\uff0cD0\uff1b MTX 3.5g\uff0f\uff4d\uff12,\uff441", "armGroupLabels": ["R-combination chemotherapy"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Overall Response Rate after 3 cycles", "description": "Percentage of patients with complete remission \uff08CR\uff09or partial remission \uff08PR\uff09", "timeFrame": "at the end of 3 cycles( each cycle is 21 days)"}, {"measure": "Overall Response Rate after 6 cycles", "description": "Percentage of patients with complete remission \uff08CR\uff09or partial remission \uff08PR\uff09", "timeFrame": "at the end of 6 cycles( each cycle is 21 days)"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Progression free survival\uff08PFS\uff09", "description": "Time from enrollment to tumor progression or death", "timeFrame": "2 years"}, {"measure": "overall survival\uff08OS\uff09", "description": "Time from enrollment to death", "timeFrame": "2 years"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

an after school ethnic dance program plus a culturally-tailored, home-based screen time reduction intervention to reduce weight gain (body mass index) among lower socioeconomic status, pre-adolescent Latina girls.", "detailedDescription": "We propose a 2-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an after school ethnic dance program plus a culturally-tailored, home-based screen time reduction intervention to reduce weight gain (body mass index) among lower socioeconomic status, pre-adolescent Latina girls. The control group will receive an \"active-placebo\" information-based health education intervention. A total of 240 7-9 year old girls will be randomized to the two conditions, and both interventions will last for the full 2-year period of the study for each girl.\n\nLatina girls are at increased risk of obesity and obesity-related morbidities. However, effective and generalizable obesity prevention programs for this rapidly growing population are not available. After school ethnic dance programs are highly motivating, and an innovative approach to providing a large \"dose\" of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for Latina girls. After school programs may also indirectly reduce sedentary behavior and improve diet. Dance is fun for pre-adolescent girls, it plays an important social and cultural role in Latino communities, and after school dance classes are a potentially generalizable \"environmental\" intervention strategy. Our past pilot studies and ongoing trials of ethnic dance interventions demonstrate that (1) dance is a highly attractive and feasible form of activity for pre-adolescent girls and (2) a dance intervention can result in reduced weight gain (BMI) and increased fitness among girls.\n\nLatina girls are also heavy consumers of screen-based media, television, videotapes/DVDs and video games. Excessive screen time is considered one of the most modifiable causes of childhood obesity. We propose a culturally-tailored, home-based screen time reduction intervention, delivered by bilingual, Latina, Community Health Advisors (CHAs). Our prior and ongoing studies demonstrate the feasibility and potential efficacy of (1) reducing children's screen time to reduce weight gain and (2) providing home-based behavior change interventions to low-income Latino families using CHAs. All interventions will be further developed, revised, and pilot-tested with Latina girls and their families through formative research.\n\n240 girls Latina girls will be recruited over 18 months from six public elementary schools serving low-income Latino communities in northern CA. Measures will be collected in girls' homes at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, including height and weight, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, blood pressure and resting heart rate, physical activity monitoring by accelerometry, media use, 24-hour dietary recalls, weight concerns, depressive symptoms, school performance, sexual maturation, and demographics. Body Mass Index (BMI) is the primary outcome measure. The primary outcome analysis will compare individual trajectories of change in BMI in the treatment and control groups over the entire two-year course of the trial, using random regression models. The study is powered (90%) to detect a clinically-significant effect. Specific Aims include:\n\n1. To test the efficacy of a combined, after school ethnic dance and home-based screen time reduction intervention to reduce weight gain (BMI) over 2 years.\n\n   Primary hypothesis: Compared to controls, girls in the treatment group will significantly reduce their weight gain (BMI) over the two-year study period.\n2. To test the effects of a combined, after school ethnic dance and home-based screen time reduction intervention on secondary outcomes over two years.\n\n   Secondary hypotheses: Compared to controls, girls in the treatment group will significantly reduce their waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, systolic and diastolic resting blood pressures, resting heart rate, television, videotape/DVD and video game use, meals eaten with TV, daily dietary energy intake, percent of energy from fat, weight concerns and depressive symptoms, and significantly increase their daily physical activity, daily moderate to vigorous physical activity, liking for physical activity, and school performance.\n3. To evaluate potential demographic, cultural, psychological, and biological moderators and mediators of intervention effects on BMI and secondary outcomes, to evaluate correlates and risk factors for change in BMI and secondary outcomes, and to evaluate intervention delivery variables and their relationships to outcomes."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Obesity", "Overweight", "Excessive

The septorhinoplasty is accompanied by insignificant bleeding on the surgical field. Excessive bleeding compromises the surgical field quality and makes more difficult the septorhinoplasty. It is very important to control and minimize excessive bleeding in surgical field by different approaches of anesthesia management. Successful approaches to reduce the excessive bleeding are; controlled hypotension by keeping the mean arterial pressure in the range of 60-70 mmHg, the reverse Trendelenburg position of the patient, administration of adrenaline (injection prior to surgery or packing soaked during surgery), and administration of tranexamic acid, which are applicable methods in many clinical centers.\n\nCardiac output may vary depending on the autonomic nervous system. The dominance of parasympathetic system effect may cause vasodilation, decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output. This vasodilation may increase bleeding during septorhinoplasty and worsen the surgical field quality. Anesthesia management may provide a clear view for the surgeon and an improved surgical field quality. The effect of carbon dioxide on vascular reactivity deserves an extra attention in septorhinoplasty required bleeding control. The intensity of bleeding in septorhinoplasty is mainly affected by mean arterial pressure and heart rate. At the same time, blood flow can be affected directly by carbon dioxide on the smooth muscular tonus of the arterioles.\n\nAfter all, it is unknown whether different carbon dioxide pressure levels have a clinically significant effect on bleeding and surgical field quality in septorhinoplasty, especially during controlled hypotension.

the most frequent glomerular disease in children. Between 80% and 90% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) will relapse following an initial response to corticosteroids. Half of these children will experience frequent relapses (FRNS) or become steroid-dependent (SDNS).\n\nThe results of multiple observational studies and randomized control trials have shown that Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the cluster of differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) antigen on B cells, is safe and effective for children with FRNS/SDNS without corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. To the investigators' knowledge, Rituximab has never been investigated for the initial episode of NS with the aim to reduce the subsequent risk of relapse that is a major concern in the management of children with NS.\n\nChildren aged 1-18 years with the first episode of the SSNS will be treated with a single intravenous infusion of Rituximab 375 mg/m2. The prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day (maximum 60 mg in single or divided doses) for 6 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) as a single morning dose on alternate days for the next 6 weeks; therapy is then discontinued."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Steroid-Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "Rituximab", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 44, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention/treatment", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Rituximab"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Rituximab", "description": "Rituximab (375 mg/m2) will be given as a single intravenous infusion after remission", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention/treatment"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "1-year relapse-free survival rate", "description": "The rate of no relapse within 1 year", "timeFrame": "1-year period after randomization"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Time to relapse (days)", "description": "Number of days from randomization to occurrence of first relapse", "timeFrame": "1-year period after administration of rituximab therapy"}, {"measure": "Proportion of patients with a relapse", "description": "The proportion of patients with relapse", "timeFrame": "6 months period after administration of rituximab therapy"}, {"measure": "B-Cell Recovery Time", "description": "Time to the first detection of CD19+ cells above 1% of total CD45+ lymphocytes after CD19+ cell depletion", "timeFrame": "1-year period after administration of rituximab therapy"}, {"measure": "The effect of rituximab on peripheral blood B cell subsets and T cell subsets to highlight biomarkers useful for monitoring response to rituximab treatment.", "description": "Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), peripheral blood B cell subsets and T cell subsets will be measured as at baseline, before and after infusion of rituximab at 3,6,12 months, and when relapse.", "timeFrame": "1-year period after administration of rituximab therapy"}, {"measure": "Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0", "description": "It is a binary variable (1/0).

Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving maximal tumor response or stabilization of disease after 6 courses may continue to receive erlotinib alone until disease progression.\n\nPatients are followed for survival.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14 months."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["recurrent breast cancer", "stage IV breast cancer", "male breast cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 39, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Erlotinib Plus Docetaxel", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Drug: docetaxel", "Drug: erlotinib hydrochloride"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "docetaxel", "description": "Docetaxel IV infusion weekly for 3 weeks with a one-week break.

differences between patients who underwent acute normovolemic hemodilution during the Autologous Blood Collection procedure in coronary artery bypass graft surgery and those who did not, using hemodynamic and cardiac data obtained by MostCare's pressure recording analytical method (PRAM).", "detailedDescription": "Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries are surgeries in which the need for blood transfusion is high. Allogeneic transfusion and transfusion-related complications have led researchers to use different techniques. Autologous blood collection method is one of the alternative methods used to eliminate the need for transfusion. The acute normovolemic hemodilution technique traditionally applied during autologous blood collection causes hemodilution in CABG surgeries and increases the risk of bleeding in patients. In this study, vasopressor infusion technique was used as an alternative technique to avoid hemodilution during autologous blood collection.

The study will enroll 30 adult participants (aged 18-60) with closed proximal tibia fractures (AO/OTA 41-A2, 41-A3) treated with plates. Participants will be allocated into three parallel groups (ten participants per group).\n\nGroup 1 - Control (Standard Practice):\n\nDuring the first six weeks, participants will not load the operated leg. After this period, they will gradually increase weight-bearing within pain tolerance. Smart Crutch Tips\u2122 will be used with indicators turned off (data collection only, without feedback).\n\nGroup 2 - AO Foundation Recommendations:\n\nParticipants will be allowed partial weight-bearing (touchdown or 10-15 kg load) with crutches or walkers according to AO Foundation guidelines. Smart Crutch Tips\u2122 will be used with indicators turned on, providing real-time feedback on loading level.\n\nGroup 3 - FEA-Based Personalized Loading:\n\nParticipants will receive individualized axial loading prescriptions developed using finite element analysis (FEA). Smart Crutch Tips\u2122 will be used with visual and auditory real-time feedback. In addition to personalized loading, participants will follow an iterative walking protocol. Participants will also perform a set of isometric and dynamic exercises to strengthen the lower limb muscles\n\nStudy Objectives:\n\nThe primary aim is to determine whether providing precise, data-driven weight-bearing recommendations-delivered via Smart Crutch Tips\u2122 with real-time visual and auditory feedback-can enhance fracture healing by promoting safe interfragmentary motion.\n\nDevice Use and Follow-Up:\n\nParticipants will use ComeBack Mobility Smart Crutch Tips\u2122 whenever they use crutches in an outpatient setting for up to 24 weeks, depending on their healing progress. These devices provide real-time guidance to help users stay within their prescribed weight-bearing range and transmit data to a centralized monitoring platform.\n\nParticipants will attend eight in-person follow-up visits: screening (Day 0-7) and then at 4, 8, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 36 weeks post-surgery. At each follow-up visit starting from Visit 1 (4 weeks), radiographic assessments (X-ray) will be performed to monitor fracture healing. Computed tomography (CT) scans will be conducted at specific time points: during the screening period (0-7 days post-surgery) and prior to Visit 1 (4 weeks), Visit 2 (8 weeks), and optionally before Visit 3 (12 weeks) , to adjust weight-bearing prescriptions and assess consolidation dynamics.\n\nData Collection:\n\nClinical data will be collected via the ComeBack Mobility app and electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Before each follow-up visit, participants will complete an online diary that includes validated questionnaires such as the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-17) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS).\n\nStandardization Across Sites:\n\nAll study procedures will follow a standardized research protocol implemented across multiple orthopedic hospitals and trauma centers in Ukraine to ensure consistency in surgical technique, data collection, and follow-up."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Treatment Duration", "Fracture Healing", "Extra-articular Proximal Tibia Fractures"], "keywords": ["Fracture Healing", "Controlled Mechanical Loading", "Weight-Bearing", "Finite Element Analysis", "Bone Union", "Digital Rehabilitation", "Smart Crutch Tips", "Biofeedback Device", "Lower Limb Fractures", "Rehabilitation Monitoring", "extra-articular proximal tibia fractures"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "maskingDescription": "Data analysts, FEA specialists and radiologists will also be blinded to group allocation until the database lock", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 30, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Control Group (Standard of Care)", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Patients in this group receive standard clinical recommendations for weight-bearing progression without the use of digital monitoring tools, specifically six weeks of non-weight-bearing.

Is there a relationship between physical activity and periodontal status?", "detailedDescription": "Patients who will visit the Periodontology Clinic will be consecutively enrolled in the study by one of the researchers (D.O.S), if they meet the following criteria:\n\n* No smoking.\n* Not having undergone dental scaling and root surface correction treatment in the last 6 months.\n* Presence of at least 20 teeth in the mouth.\n* Not pregnant and/or breastfeeding.\n* Patients taking drugs known to alter bone metabolism or having established degenerative bone diseases (hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis).\n* Patients who have not received antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids for \\>2 weeks in the 3 months prior to the study.\n* Patients who agree to participate will undergo an oral examination and answer a questionnaire survey.\n\nPeriodontal Examination: Routine clinical periodontal parameters such as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), Probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment levels, and gingival recession will be recorded in all patient groups before treatment \\[13\\]. Individuals will be classified according to the 2017 classification \\[14\\].\n\nAfter 30 seconds, at six locations per tooth, a calibrated clinical researcher will measure the probing depth (PD), which is the distance between the free gingival margin and the pocket depth, the clinical attachment level (CAL), which is the distance between the cement-enamel attachment and the pocket depth, and the bleeding on probing (BOP) \\[15\\]. According to the World Workshop on Classification and Conditions of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases 2017, periodontitis will be identified \\[14\\]. The PD severity index will be calculated as the percentage of teeth with PD higher than or equal to 4 mm in two or more interproximal locations \\[16\\]. Mean PD, CAL, and BoP will also be obtained. Additionally, the quantity of teeth will be recorded.\n\nTo the individuals included in the research; A questionnaire consisting of 16 questions including demographic data of individuals, the number of daily snacks, daily carbohydrate-containing food and sugary drink consumption frequency, tooth brushing frequency, and duration, education level, and oral care habits will be filled \\[17\\].\n\nDietary habits: assessed by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) questionnaire and classified as low adherence (score \u22645), medium adherence (score 6-9), or high adherence (score \u226510) \\[18, 19\\].\n\nDental Examination: Number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) assessed by visual inspection and radiographic assessment following the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). All tooth surfaces will be examined, but the observations will be recorded per tooth \\[20\\].\n\nPhysical activity assessment: PA will be assessed through the validated short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)\\[21\\]. The IPAQ automatic report will categorize the total PA level as low, moderate, or high (https: //theipaq/home).\n\n2.5 Statistical analysis Using IBM SPSS V23, the data will be examined. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests will be used to gauge conformity to the normal distribution. Multiple comparisons will be examined using the Bonferroni Corrected Z Test, and categorical variables will be examined using the Pearson Chi-Square Test. To compare the parameters with the normal distribution according to the groups, a one-way analysis of variance will be utilized. The parameters that do not meet the normal distribution according to the groups will be compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple comparisons using the Dunn test. For categorical variables, the analysis findings will be shown as frequency (%), whereas for quantitative variables, the results will be shown as mean, standard deviation, and median (minimum to maximum). P 0.050 will be used as the significance level. The risk factors affecting the disease will be examined by Binary Logistic Regression Analysis, and the Enter method will be used to include the variables in the model. Analysis results will be presented as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables and as mean \u00b1 standard deviation for quantitative variables.

Survivors are often disabled. Therefore, there is a broad consensus that UIA with surgical indication should be aggressively intervened. The efficacy and safety of flow diverter (FD) in the treatment of UIA has been confirmed by many large clinical trials. Currently, FD placement for UIA is performed under general anesthesia (GA) in most centers, however, some studies have observed that FD placement under local anesthesia (LA) is not as effective as FD placement under general anesthesia and have demonstrated the feasibility of FD placement under local anesthesia (LA) with high technical success rates and low perioperative complication rates and mortality. However, the retrospective design and relatively limited sample size of the above studies may introduce significant bias and affect the confidence of the conclusions. Therefore, the present trial was designed as a randomized controlled trial with the aim of comparing the safety and efficacy of GA and LA in UIA patients undergoing FD placement. The results of this study will help inform future multicenter trials to validate the impact of anesthesia choice on the safety and efficacy in UIA patients undergoing FD placement."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Intracranial Aneurysm"], "keywords": ["Unruptured intracranial aneurysm", "Flow diverter", "General anesthesia", "Local anesthesia"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "maskingDescription": "Researchers responsible for outcome assessment are unaware of the allocation of anesthesia modalities, but anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons are aware of the allocation of anesthesia modalities because they need to be involved in the safe administration of general or local anesthesia and related medical care.", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 188, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Local anesthesia group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients in the local anesthesia group received only local anesthesia at the femoral artery puncture site without anesthesia drugs such as conscious sedation.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Different anesthesia methods, namely local anesthesia and general anesthesia"]}, {"label": "General anesthesia group", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Patients in the general anesthesia group received not only local anesthesia at the femoral artery puncture site, but also fast-induction anesthesia with tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask insertion using isoproterenol, remifentanil, and muscle relaxants.", "interventionNames": ["Other: Different anesthesia methods, namely local anesthesia and general anesthesia"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Different anesthesia methods, namely local anesthesia and general anesthesia", "description": "Patients in the local anesthesia group received only local anesthesia at the femoral artery puncture site without anesthesia drugs such as conscious sedation.\n\nPatients in the general anesthesia group received not only local anesthesia at the femoral artery puncture site, but also fast-induction anesthesia with tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask insertion using isoproterenol, remifentanil, and muscle relaxants.", "armGroupLabels": ["General anesthesia group", "Local anesthesia group"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Good neurologic status", "description": "Defined as an mRS score of \u22642 (i.e., asymptomatic or without significant disability)", "timeFrame": "90 days after intervention"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Newly developed cerebral ischemic foci", "description": "Determination was based on DWI sequences of cranial MRI", "timeFrame": "Within 48 hours of flow diverter placement"}, {"measure": "Status of cognitive function", "description": "Cognitive functioning status assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).

Children constitute the largest group of victims of such injuries. Spoke wheel injury, road traffic accident are common mode in the children. These injuries can range from simple minor abrasions, lacerations to crushing of heel. Injury to heel pad and flap has serious impact in day to day life, causing disability because it is the major weight bearing area and inherently lacks adequate soft tissue.\n\nManagement of injury of heel pad in children depends on severity and extent of soft tissue injury. Oestern and Tscherne have classified soft tissue injuries into four grades from 0-4. The treatment of Grade 0 and 1 injuries is typical cleansing and application of a moist wound healing dressing. But further grades need surgical management with debridement and reconstruction.\n\nGrade III and IV can be reconstructed by using graft, flaps or various other techniques. Simple skin graft, lateral rotational skin flap, local muscle flaps, ingenious fasciocutaneous island flaps, cross-leg or cross foot flap, free tissue transfer and staged or distant jumped flaps are historically included in reconstructive ladder in repairing these soft tissue injuries. Generally, free flap reconstruction is the ultimate step of degloving wound coverage. Despite availability of various reconstructive techniques, covering of soft tissue loss of heel in traumatic events, remains a difficult and demanding procedure, especially when it is associated with fractures and complex wounds. Skin grafting offers poor functional and cosmetic results, although it is commonly performed with good take rates.\n\nStem cells are potential alternative to promote cutaneous wound healing because of its unique features like self-renewal and differentiation capacity. Mesenchymal stem cells are type of adult stem cells that reside in various tissues of the body. Besides, these cells are preferred for cell based therapies because they have immunomodulatory properties. These cells can be isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue and human umbilical cord blood and tissue. Recently,umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells have shown a tremendous potential for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Previous studies indicate that these mesenchymal stem cells can accelerate wound healing by enhanced proliferation and migration of human fibroblast, enhancing secretion of elastin, synthesizing collagen, angiogenesis and further maturing blood vessels present in wound site. Stem cell-based therapies will definitely be the major part of clinical medicine in next decade.\n\nIn the current study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord with informed consent from the mothers. This study will open a new avenue for the treatment of heel pad injury. Considering the role of stem cells in wound healing, study has been designed to accelerate the wound healing process in children with heel pad injury. Since the use of stem cell (especially in Pakistan) is completely a new technique in the management of heel pad injury, it will provide insight for better management by accelerating the wound healing process, reducing the hospital stay and cost of treatment.

Immediately loaded mini implants have similar failure rates compared to mini implants receiving a delayed 6-week protocol;\n3. Flapless surgery has similar post-insertion outcomes compared to flapped surgery.\n\nStatement of clinical relevance:\n\nMini implants are an alternative to standard implants for overdentures. They are suitable for insertion in narrow ridges, are less invasive, simpler, less costly, and faster to perform, and are especially advantageous for older and frail patients who would benefit from more conservative and less burdensome treatments. Although previous studies reported favorable outcomes regarding patient oral comfort and function, there is a need for implant/attachment systems with higher predictability on implant survival and retention performance in the long-term. This study aims to provide clinical evidence on the newly developed 2.4mm one-piece TiZr mini implant with a miniaturized carbon-based coating attachment.\n\nMethods:\n\nThis is a randomized clinical trial using a factorial design, to test the effectiveness of a mandibular overdenture retained by four mini implants. Participants will be randomized using a 2\u00d72 factorial design: immediate/delayed loading (factor 1) and flapless/flapped surgery (factor 2). New conventional complete dentures will be provided as the baseline treatment. Next, eligible participants will be those who completed a 6-month period of denture usage, and are in need of implants to improve the function of the mandibular denture. Imaging exam should present a minimum of 5.4 mm of ridge width in the interforaminal region (recommended for flapless surgery).\n\nIncluded subjects to take part in the RCT will be randomized to the treatment groups according to the combined study factors - loading protocols: immediate (IL) or delayed (DL); and surgical approaches: flapless (FLS) or flapped (FPS) surgery. Hence, the combined factors will results in four groups:\n\n* IL/FLS (Group I)\n* IL/FPS (Group II)\n* DL/FLS (Group III)\n* DL/FPS (Group IV) Considering the patient's perspective this study design assumed a \"worst\" protocol (delayed and flapped - Group IV) and a \"best\" protocol (flapless and immediate - Group I) and two other intermediary conditions (flapped/immediate and flapless/delayed).\n\nAll participants will receive four Straumann\u00ae Mini Implant System (one-piece Tissue Level implants) with an Optiloc\u00ae prosthetic connection and PEEK matrix inserts. Surgery will follow the workflow for the surgical procedure for the Straumann\u00ae Mini Implant System concerning preoperative planning, implant bed preparation and implant insertion. For the prosthetic procedures, we will perform a chairside incorporation of the retentive inserts to convert the existing well-fitting and well-functioning lower denture into an overdenture with the Optiloc\u00ae Retentive System/Straumann\u00ae Mini Implants.\n\nOutcomes will include short-term outcomes (Patient perceived burdens in surgery, postoperative swelling and pain, consumption of analgesics and surgical time) and long-term - 1-year (implant survival and success, peri-implant marginal bone level changes, PROMs, retention force, prosthodontic events) outcomes.

The changes rang from point mutation to small-scale genomic change and even the change of whole chromosome number. It has been reported that the characteristics of genomic rearrangement can be used as a marker of clinical outcome of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and specific genomic rearrangement are related to the poor prognosis. In noninvasive gene detection with low coverage, patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer have deteriorating progression-free and overall survivals regardless of the tumor stage when somatic copy number distortion (sCNA) exceeds the threshold in plasma. The detection rate of sCNA increased along with the tumor stage. We enrolled those as our target patients, who are diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer and willing to take part in. The CIN in peripheral cell-free DNA was observed before initial treatment, after primary debulking or staging surgeries, before recurrence and during the process of recurrence treatment.

While the complications from a sentinel lymph node dissection are less than that of a complete axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node dissection still carries small risks of arm swelling, decreased movement, fluid collections, nerve injury, and pain. Furthermore, the majority of sentinel lymph nodes do not contain cancer.

Traditional methods, such as shaving, depilatories, tweezing and waxing result in only temporary hair removal, and thus require extensive maintenance. Long term hair removal via electrolysis is generally unsatisfactory due to its time consuming, painful nature and the associated risk of scarring or pigmentary changes. Moreover, the efficacy of electrolysis is user dependent and is estimated to be reduction of only 15-50% of the unwanted hair3.\n\nThe more modern approach to long term hair removal involves laser and Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatment modalities. These technologies are based on the scientific principle of selective photothermolysis. During the treatment, the light energy is absorbed by the hair's pigment (melanin) and transmitted through the hair shaft to the follicle. Conversion of this energy into heat causes a rise in the hair temperature, leading to destruction of the follicle and disruption of the hair growth mechanism, while leaving the skin undamaged.\n\nBoth laser and light devices have been proven successful in inducing permanent hair removal, as well as delayed hair growth, while causing minimal discomfort and complications. The light devices are based on the IPL technology, which differs from laser light in various physical aspects. The main difference is that while lasers emit light at a distinct wavelength, IPL delivers a wide range of wavelengths (400 1400 nm), thus allowing greater flexibility in aspects of body area, hair color and skin type LEORTEC LTD. has developed an innovative device that integrates the two treatment modalities: Laser and Intense Pulse Light (IPL) and in addition MLS - Multi Light Source- a combination of the two modalities.

Informal caregivers have reported different types of need and have shown dissatisfaction with technical and emotional support delivered by community health teams. Furthermore, empowering informal caregivers who care after older stroke survivors is an important challenge, preventing them from negative outcomes such as burden, anxiety and depression or loss of physical function or hospitalization in older people.\n\nObjectives: This pilot study aims to implement and evaluate the impact of an intervention based on training and telephone support delivered to informal caregivers who care after older people post-stroke.\n\nSetting: Community health units in Northern Portugal region. Design/Methods: This single blinded randomized trial will be delivered by a community nursing team to informal caregivers 1 week, 1 and 3 months after a hospital discharge.\n\nStudy outcome(s): The primary outcomes will be informal caregivers\u00b4 empowerment. Secondary outcomes will include burden and health quality of life in caregivers; functionality, hospital readmission and institutionalization of older people stroke survivors, measured 1 and 3 months after intervention.\n\nResults/Conclusion: Data collection started in February and will be concluded in August 2014. First results will be published at the beginning of 2015. The InCARE programme will be the first pilot in informal caregivers study ever conducted in Portugal. It will highlight new ways to support caregivers who take care of older people after a stroke.

This approach not only monitors patients' behavior, but also caregivers', and infers the underlying dynamics of their interactions, such as changes in mood and stress. - The second is the automated creation of classifiers and inference modules tailored to the particular patients and dementia conditions (such as different stages of dementia). - The third is an adaptive recommendation system that closes the loop of an in-home behavior monitoring system."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Caregiver Stress Syndrome"], "keywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia", "Caregiving", "Smart Health Technology"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "interventionModelDescription": "Longitudinal descriptive", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 22, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Dementia/Caregiver Dyad", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "All dementia/caregiver dyads will have in-home acoustic monitoring to classify mood and will be provided mindfulness-based stress reduction recommendations via a smart phone.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Mood Monitoring and Behavioral Recommendation System"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Mood Monitoring and Behavioral Recommendation System", "description": "The purpose of this project is to develop a monitoring, modeling, and interactive recommendation solution (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on caregiver-patient relationships.

Almost all professional societies (American Cancer Society, American Urologic Association, American College of Physicians, United States Preventive Services Task Force) advocate that patients receive education and complete an informed decision-making discussion with their medical providers about the pros and cons of the PSA test, as well as their personal preferences, before proceeding with this test.

Nowadays the use of Succinylcholine (CELOCURINE), a neuromuscular blockade with a short duration of action, is recommended in this indication. However, several adverse events are frequently reported, especially anaphylactic reaction, restraining its use for rapid sequence intubation. Other adverse effects such as extended neuromuscular block, malignant hyperthermia or severe hyperkaliemia prohibit its use. In this case the use of another neuromuscular blockade, Rocuronium (ESMERON), is an alternative solution. Unfortunately, this other molecule causes as many anaphylactic event as Succinylcholine (1 anaphylactic event for 3000 uses) and produce a long duration of neuromuscular block. Incidence of anaphylactic reaction is increasing in France and mostly severe reactions. Its utilization is therefore reduced to 31 to 55% of crush induction despite the recommendations. Remifentanil is an opioid agent with very shorts delay and duration of action. Several study have shown similar intubation conditions in planned surgery with the use of Remifentanil instead of neuromuscular blockade and less hemodynamic reactions. Remifentanil is already approved for anesthetic induction and recognized as an alternative to neuromuscular blockade for the intubation of children. Use of remifentanil has shown satisfying intubation conditions for adults but its incidence of major complications compared to succinylcholine remains unknown.\n\nStudy hypothesis: The investigators thus hypothesized that Remifentanil is non inferior to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction.\n\nMethods: A multicenter simple blind randomized controlled trial. 11 centers will participate in this project.\n\nExperimental treatment arm: During anesthetic induction remifentanil will be injected immediately after hypnotic drug through bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access, at 3 to 4 \u00b5g/kg. Orotracheal intubation will be performed 30 to 60 seconds later by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters.\n\nControl arm treatment: A neuromuscular blockade will be injected right after the hypnotic drug. Whether succinylcholine (CELOCURINE) at 1mg/kg or Rocuronium (ESMERON) at 1mg/kg in a bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access. Orotracheal intubation will be performed after occurring of fasciculations with succinylcholine or 30 to 60 seconds after injection of Rocuronium by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters.\n\nObjective and judgment criteria: The primary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of Remifentanil compared to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction. Primary endpoint is the rate of tracheal intubation without major complications as defined by 1/ tracheal intubation with less than 2 laryngoscopies 2/ no aspiration during the 10 minutes after induction 3/ no desaturation under 95% during the 10 minutes after induction 4/ no hypo or hypertension as defined by a Median blood pressure\\<50 mmHg or \\>110 mmHg 5/ NO ventricular arrhythmia involving an emergency treatment or cardiac arrest during the 10 minutes after induction 6/ No grade III or IV anaphylactic reaction after the 10 minutes after induction.\n\nStatistical analyses:\n\nA 80% incidence of intubation without major complication was hypothesized. Non inferiority has been set under a superior limit of 7% for the primary endpoint 95% of the proportions difference between intervention and control group. In order to achieve 80 power with a 5% alpha risk, 1150 patients (575 for each arms) are to be included."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Intra-tracheal Intubation"], "keywords": ["Intubation",

Ascites is the usual first sign.Hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are also features of decompensation, but in these patients, ascites invariably occurs first. Compensated cirrhotic patients have none of these features.\n\nThe thyroid gland produces two-related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Acting through thyroid hormone receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2, these hormones play a critical role in cell differentiation during development and help maintain thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis in the adult. T4 is secreted from the thyroid gland in about twenty-fold excess over T3. Both hormones are bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin (formerly known as thyroxine binding prealbumin), and albumin.\n\nThe liver plays an important role in the metabolism of thyroid hormones, as it is the most important organ in the peripheral conversion of tetraiodothyronine (T4) to T3 by Type 1 deiodinase. Type I deiodinase is the major enzyme in the liver and accounts for approximately 30%-40% of extrathyroidal production of T3, it can carry out both 5'-and 5-deiodination of T4 to T3. Moreover, the liver is involved in thyroid hormone conjugation and excretion, as well as the synthesis of thyroid binding globulin. T4 and T3 regulate the basal metabolic rate of all cells, including hepatocytes, and thereby modulate hepatic function. The liver metabolizes the THS and regulates their systemic endocrine effects. Thyroid diseases may perturb liver function; liver disease modulates thyroid hormone metabolism; and a variety of systemic diseases affect both the organs.\n\nThere are clinical and laboratory associations between thyroid and liver diseases. Patients with chronic liver disease may have thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism. Patients with subacute thyroiditis or hyperthyroidism may have abnormalities in liver function tests, which return to normal as the thyroid condition improves.\n\nAvailable studies showed most frequent change in plasma level of thyroid hormones is decreased total T3 and free T3 concentration which is reported to be associated with severity of hepatic dysfunction. But no study clearly mentioned FT4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with severity of liver cirrhosis. Serum T4 levels either remain normal or slightly low. However, serum TSH levels remain normal or slightly raised. These changes in thyroid hormone levels are so well established that some workers have advocated its use as a sensitive index of liver function.\n\nAim of work\n\n* Primary - To study thyroid hormone level (FT3, FT4, and TSH) in the liver cirrhosis patient.\n* Secondary - To find out the significance of thyroid hormone level and severity of cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nPatients and Methods Study Design Case control study. Study groups This case-control study included apparently healthy controls (25 individiual) and liver cirrhosis patients (25 cases) from wards, outpatient department, and Intensive Care Unit in Specialized Medical Hospital with clinical, biochemical, and radiological evidence of cirrhosis of liver.\n\nSample size calculation was based on mean difference of between cases \\& control groups retrieved from previous research.Sample size calculation was based on t test to compare between 2 means .Using G\\*power version 3.0.10 to calculate sample size , with the calculated sample size will be 50 (25 in each group) , 2 tailed test , \u03b1 error =0.05 and power = 90.0% , effect size =0.95\n\nDuration of study: 1 year Methods\n\n1.

While dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is recommended for one year in patients undergoing CABG for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the optimal antiplatelet strategy for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) remains unclear. In fact, current guidelines show discrepancies, with the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) recommending DAPT for one year to reduce the risk of saphenous vein graft (SVG) occlusion (Class IIb), while the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends switching to aspirin monotherapy to reduce bleeding risk and considers DAPT only for high-risk patients (Class IIb). However, aspirin monotherapy may also not be the optimal alternative due to its limited efficacy in preventing thrombotic events and its inability to significantly reduce major bleeding compared to DAPT. Recently, clopidogrel monotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative, potentially offering both ischemic protection and a lower bleeding risk compared to DAPT even compared to aspirin monotherapy. An observational study comparing clopidogrel monotherapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin after CABG found that clopidogrel monotherapy demonstrated comparable to the combination therapy group. While this suggests that clopidogrel monotherapy could be a viable alternative, previous study was limited by its short follow-up duration and lack of bleeding outcome assessment. Thus, the investigators performed target trial emulation to evaluate long-term ischemic and bleeding outcomes associated with DAPT, aspirin monotherapy, and clopidogrel monotherapy in CCS patients following CABG."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Chronic Coronary Syndrome", "Coronary Artery Bypass Graft CABG"], "keywords": ["antiplatelet drug", "Dual antiplatelet therapy", "Single antiplatelet therapy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "COHORT", "timePerspective": "RETROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 29898, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Dual antiplatelet therapy", "description": "Patients who were prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) at the date of discharge from te index hospitalization for CABG"}, {"label": "Aspirin monotherapy", "description": "Patients who were prescribed single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) at the date of discharge from te index hospitalization for CABG"}, {"label": "Clopidogrel monotherapy", "description": "Patients who were prescribed single antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel) at the date of discharge from te index hospitalization for CABG"}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)", "description": "Composite of all cause death, spontaneous MI, and stroke", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}, {"measure": "Major GI bleeding", "description": "Major GI bleeding requiring transfusion", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "All cause death", "description": "death from any cause", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}, {"measure": "Spontaneous myocardial infarction", "description": "Myocardial infarction with hospitalozation", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}, {"measure": "Stroke", "description": "Stroke after CABG", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}, {"measure": "Repeat revascularization", "description": "Additional PCI or CABG after discharge", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}, {"measure": "Bleeding evet", "description": "Any bleeding requiring transfusion", "timeFrame": "10 year after CABG"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with underwent Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) between January 2010 and December 2020\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* In-hospital death\n* Not prescribed SAPT or DAPT\n* Received CABG due to myocardial infarction or had myocardial infarction\n* Received CABG due to unstable angina or had unstable angina\n* History of PCI\n* Pre-existing Intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding\n* Oral anticoagulant prescription at discharge", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"], "studyPopulation": "Patients who were prescribed antiplatete therapy after undergoing CABG", "samplingMethod": "NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}, "ipdSharingStatementModule": {"ipdSharing": "NO"}}, "derivedSection": {"miscInfoModule": {"versionHolder": "2025-10-28"}}, "hasResults": false}, {"protocolSection": {"identificationModule": {"nctId": "NCT04011501", "orgStudyIdInfo": {"id": "HCB/2019/0377"}, "organization": {"fullName": "Hospital Clinic of Barcelona", "class": "OTHER"}, "briefTitle": "Erector Spinae Plane Block for Minimal Invasive Cardiac Surgery (Heart-Port).", "officialTitle": "Erector Spinae Plane Block for Minimal Invasive Cardiac Surgery (Heart-Port).", "acronym": "ESP"}, "statusModule": {"statusVerifiedDate": "2019-07", "overallStatus": "UNKNOWN", "lastKnownStatus": "RECRUITING", "expandedAccessInfo": {"hasExpandedAccess": false}, "startDateStruct": {"date": "2019-05-07", "type": "ACTUAL"}, "primaryCompletionDateStruct": {"date": "2019-09-01", "type": "ESTIMATED"}, "completionDateStruct": {"date": "2019-10-01", "type": "ESTIMATED"}, "studyFirstSubmitDate": "2019-07-02", "studyFirstSubmitQcDate": "2019-07-04", "studyFirstPostDateStruct": {"date": "2019-07-08", "type": "ACTUAL"}, "lastUpdateSubmitDate": "2019-07-10", "lastUpdatePostDateStruct": {"date": "2019-07-12", "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "sponsorCollaboratorsModule": {"responsibleParty": {"type": "PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR", "investigatorFullName": "Xavier Sala-Blanch", "investigatorTitle": "Principal Investigator", "investigatorAffiliation": "Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"}, "leadSponsor": {"name": "Hospital Clinic of Barcelona", "class": "OTHER"}}, "oversightModule": {"oversightHasDmc": false, "isFdaRegulatedDrug": false, "isFdaRegulatedDevice": false}, "descriptionModule": {"briefSummary": "Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is performed through a right thoracotomy, the pain management of this surgery is of great importance.

In Canada there are an estimated 240,000 people infected with HCV. The current study addresses the hypothesis that neurocognitive and neurochemical abnormalities may occur in individuals with HCV-infection who do not have liver cirrhosis or vasculitic neuropathy, and this may result from a direct effect of HCV on the Central Nervous System (CNS). The purpose of this study is to assess whether infection with the Hepatitis-C virus is associated with changes in thinking skills and brain chemistry, in patients who do not have liver cirrhosis. In addition, we are examining whether such changes in thinking skills and brain chemistry are reversed by antiviral treatment. We are also studying whether factors such as fatigue and depression have an effect on thinking skills in people with Hepatitis-C. In order to take into account the impact of having viral hepatitis, we will be comparing the results of the Hepatitis-C group to the results of a group of patients with Hepatitis-B, and to a group of individuals who do not have Hepatitis.", "detailedDescription": "The current proposal addresses the hypothesis that neurocognitive and neurochemical abnormalities may occur in individuals with HCV-infection who do not have liver cirrhosis or vasculitic neuropathy, and that this phenomenon may result from a direct effect of HCV on the Central Nervous System (CNS). Our hypothesis originated from the frequently reported complaints of forgetfulness and decreased ability to concentrate ('brain fog') in our patients with chronic HCV-infection, as well as from clinical observation of cognitive impairment in a moderate proportion of non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients. Patients with HCV-infection also report significant impairment in most realms of everyday function, and greater reductions in quality of life (QOL) than individuals infected with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). These results cannot be attributed to degree of liver inflammation, or the mode of acquisition of infection. Based on the well-established association between neurocognitive function and quality of life, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these QOL differences between HCV and HBV are the result of cerebral compromise in individuals infected with HCV, and consequent neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive dysfunction.\n\nNon-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients were found to be impaired on speeded measures of sustained attention and working memory relative to control subjects. MRS results from the same study suggested that there may also be neurochemical changes associated with HCV that can be observed even in infected individuals with normal liver status (as determined by biopsy). In particular, an increase in choline ratios, was detected in the basal ganglia and white matter. This pattern appears to be specific to HCV-infection as abnormalities were not found in patients with Hepatitis-B infection. Furthermore, the degree of neurochemical abnormality was correlated with neuropsychological performance. Similar increases in choline levels have been reported in subcortical brain regions in individuals infected with HIV-1, even prior to the onset of symptomatic infection and signs of cognitive dysfunction.\n\nRationale: Mechanism through which HCV may have direct CNS effects A plausible mechanism for direct CNS effects of HCV involves passage of the virus into brain tissue through infection of circulating lymphocytes. In fact, a number of studies have revealed the presence of HCV RNA-negative strand (an intermediate of viral replication) within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC). However, the issue of extra-hepatic replication in PBMC remains controversial due to contrary findings and methodological criticisms. However, more recently Laskus and colleagues demonstrated the presence of HCV RNA-negative strand in PBMC in 40-60% of HCV-infected individuals with HIV-1 co-infection, and in a separate investigation determined the presence of HCV RNA-negative strand in monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, and CD19+ cells in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected individuals. Thus, it is plausible that HCV enters the brain through circulating lymphocytes, and that consequent neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive, and neurochemical abnormalities are related to the presence of HCV in the CNS in a way that is not yet understood. Corroborating this hypothesis is the recent observation by Thomas and colleagues (personal communication) that HCV can be detected in the brain tissue of infected individuals upon neuropathological examination of autopsy tissue. This proposed mechanism for direct CNS effects of HCV-infection is similar to that which is thought to be the cause of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive impaiiment. Early in the course of the HIV-1 epidemic came the realization of frequent neurological complications, including neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive, and motor dysfunction. These symptoms could not be attributed to opportunistic infection of the CNS (e.g. toxoplasmosis; neoplasms), and often progressed to a stage of dementia, which came to be known as HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The incidence of HAD has declined drastically subsequent to the advent of antiretroviral treatment. HIV-1 is thought to enter the brain very early in the course of initial infection, possibly through the infection of peripheral monocytes and macrophages that cross the blood-brain barrier. In HAD, there is a complex and indirect mechanism of CNS damage that may occur years after initial HIV-1 infection, usually under conditions of immunocompromise. HIV-1 does not directly infect neurons, but rather replicates within brain macrophages and microglia. These cells subsequently become immunoactive, and release secretory neurotoxic substances that ultimately lead to a breakdown of homeostatic mechanisms, and a consequent cascade of inflammatory events. The resulting metabolic encephalopathy damages, and eventually destroys CNS neurons. The most prominent neuropathological features of HAD occur in white matter and deep grey matter regions of the brain, and include myelin pallor, multinucleated giant cells, and occasionally encephalitis characterized by disseminated, multifocal microgranulomas composed of elongated microglia, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Thus, given preliminary findings of extra-hepatic replication within PBMC as a plausible mechanism for infiltration of CNS by HCV-infected lymphocytes, neuropathological detection of HCV within the CNS, clinical observation and patient complaints of cognitive deficits, and reduction in HRQOL beyond that observed in chronic HBV-infection, it is possible that HCV may have direct CNS effects that elicit a consequent inflammatory reaction that interferes with neuronal function in a manner similar to the neuropathological processes associated with HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, there are parallels between MRS findings for HIV-1 and those reported in HCV-infection in non-cirrhotic patients. In particular, HIV-1 is marked by an increase in choline-containing compounds (Cho), similar to the preliminary findings of Forton and colleagues (1999; 2000). This increase in subcortical Cho can be found in HIV-1 positive patients even in the absence of cognitive dysfunction, suggesting it may be a very early marker of CNS involvement. Other changes, notably a decrease in N-acetylaspartate, are apparent in HIV-1 infected individuals with significant neuropsychological impairment, indicating an evolution of CNS disease. Of importance, antiretroviral therapy appears to reverse the Cho abnormalities, and also results in significant improvements in neurocognitive function.\n\nObjectives Phase I In the first phase, we will determine whether non-cirrhotic individuals with chronic HCV-infection (who do not have cryoglobulinemia) manifest abnormalities in brain biochemistry and neurocognitive performance. This will be accomplished by comparing HCV-infected individuals to subjects with HBV-infection (to control for the effects of viral hepatitis), and to an age-matched control group on measures of neurocognitive performance and MRS after careful screening to rule out the presence of other conditions that may affect cognitive performance. We will also determine whether there is a relationship between MRS-quantified brain biochemistry and neurocognitive performance. Finally, we will reveal the determinants of neurocognitive impairment and neurochemical abnormalities using multivariate analyses, to evaluate the relative contribution of other clinical parameters associated with HCV-infection, such as fatigue, mood / psychiatric symptoms, serum aminotransferase levels, degree of fibrosis, viral load.\n\nPhase II In the second phase of our investigation, we will determine whether HCV-infected patients who achieve a sustained virological response to antiviral therapy (no HCV RNA detectable in serum) will show amelioration of cerebral metabolite abnormalities and cognitive impairment at follow-up (6 months following the cessation of treatment), compared to patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment and compared to an age-matched control group (the same control subjects tested in Phase I of the investigation). In the group that does not respond to treatment, MRS abnormalities will remain unchanged, or may worsen. A control group is particularly important for the NP assessment aspect of the investigation, in order to account for practice effects that may result from repeated administration of NP tests. Patients with HBV-infection will not be re-tested at this point, because we do not expect to see any abnormalities in this group at the initial assessment point. In addition, if HBV-infected patients were started on antiviral treatment following their liver biopsy, it is likely that they will still be receiving treatment 1-5 years later. The rationale for timing the final assessment of HCV patients 6 months after the cessation of antiviral therapy involves the known neuropsychiatric sequelae of treatment with Interferon (which may otherwise affect the cognitive assessment). Efficacy of antiviral treatment of HCV with Interferon and ribavirin At the time of this submission, treatment with IFNa2b plus ribavirin is the standard of care for patients with chronic HCV-infection. However, recently published data indicates that when interferon is pegylated (covalently bound to polyethylene glycol), efficacy is markedly enhanced in comparison to standard IFNa2b plus ribavirin. Enhanced efficacy is likely due to the sustained elevation of IFN in serum, due to delay of its renal excretion. Thus, weekly (rather than three times weekly) injections are required. Pilot study data indicates that the efficacy of pegylated IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin is even more effective. This portion of the investigation is an add-on to a safety study involving treatment with 6 or 12 months of Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a plus ribabvirin (UHN # 01-0082). We expect that the rate of sustained virological responders in non-cirrhotic patients will be approximately 54%.\n\nMETHODS: Subjects - In total, 150 subjects will participate in the investigation, 100 of which will be assessed on two different occasions, approximately 1.5 years apart. Fifty patients with chronic Hepatitis C infection (HCV), fifty with chronic Hepatitis B infection (HBV), and fifty healthy control subjects will be recruited to participate in the investigation. All participants will undergo screening procedures to rule out conditions that can affect cognitive function. Those that are deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will participate in the first phase of the investigation in which they will be assessed with Physical, Neurological, Psychiatric, and Neuropsychological examinations, as well as with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. In the second phase of the investigation, HCV patients and control subjects will be reassessed after an interval of 1.0 to 1.5 years to determine whether antiviral treatment is effective at ameliorating neurocognitive and brain biochemical abnormalities identified in the first phase of the investigation.\n\nMaterials: Assessments and Procedures Screening Assessments Liver Biopsy All HCV and BBV patients who have received a liver biopsy as part of their clinical management will be eligible to participate in the current investigation, although no patient will receive a biopsy for the purposes of this investigation. Instead, participants will be recruited from the pool of subjects who are receiving clinical care at the UHNTWH Liver Clinic who have had a recent liver biopsy performed, and will be progressing to treatment (both HBV and HCV patients).\n\nLaboratory Assessment HCV and HBV patients will undergo a screening laboratory assessment that will consist of hematological assessment, blood chemistry, and urinalysis as per the protocol for the clinical trial that this investigation is being added on to (UHN # 01-0082). In addition, supplementary laboratory assessments will be conducted to screen for other parameters that may be related to cognitive function. In particular, the following tests will be performed: RBC/Folate, Hb Urea, Electrolytes, Bl2, TSH, Cryoglobulins, INR, Albumin.\n\nPhysical Evaluation All HCV and HBV patients will be assessed by the Principle Investigator for clinical signs of liver disease, and will also have a general physical examination as specified in the clinical trial protocol (UHN # 01-0082). HBV patients will be assessed by the Principle Investigator in a similar manner. The results of this assessment will be used to screen for signs of clinically significant liver disease (e.g. stigmata, asterixis, liver size, spleen size, jaundice, ascites or edema, as well as for other conditions related to liver disease that could possibly affect cognition and thus exclude the participant from participation in the investigation (e.g. cryogloubulinemia).\n\nNeurological Examination: Patients will be examined by the study neurologist for the presence of conditions that would result in exclusion from the investigation. The neurologist will also examine the patients for signs of peripheral neuropathy that could indicate the presence of cryoglobulinemia (e.g. dysesthesia or hypesthesia, motor weakness, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, and positive pyramidal signs). In addition, the neurological examination will be conducted during the final visit in order to determine whether any of the neurological side effects known to be associated with Interferon therapy have persisted beyond the 6 month wash-out period.\n\nPsychiatric Examination: The patient will be examined by the study psychiatrist to determine current and lifetime presence of psychiatric diagnoses that could result in their exclusion from the investigation.

Multifractionated high dose radiotherapy (HR) targeting various tumor sites could also increase occurrence of tumor mutations and the diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire of intratumoral T cells.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to combine nivolumab with 3 fractions of HR of one metastasis for each tumor site (defined as skin/muscle, thoracic, abdomen, bone, other).\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that combining nivolumab with multisite, multifractionated HR increases the overall survival rate at 1 year compared to published data with nivolumab alone.", "detailedDescription": "Recent progress has been made in advanced melanoma with drug targeting immune system such as ipilimumab targeting CTLA-4 and nivolumab targeting PD-1. Some case reports and preclinical data suggested that the antitumoral immune response of these immune check point inhibitors (ipilimumab and nivolumab as well) could be enhanced if associated with massive tumoral antigen release in the blood stream, due to local treatment such as high dose radiotherapy (HR). The first rigorous scientific demonstration of this phenomenon was done by Demaria et al. They showed that irradiation of xenograft tumor could induce decrease of tumoral growth of a non-irradiated other xenograt tumor. This effect was due to immune response to irradiation but it only occured when immune system was modulated by CTLA-4 inhibition. In that experiences CTLA4 and radiation actions were synergistic.\n\nDovedi et al. also reported that targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have greater anti-tumor efficacy if concomitant radiotherapy was given and especially if radiotherapy was multifractionated.\n\nVery interestingly the fractionated radiotherapy also induced huge increase of tumoral PD-L1 expression by three times 5 days after beginning of radiotherapy. This could explain the synergistic impact of this strategy.\n\nAt least eight clinical studies are ongoing, testing the combination of CTLA-4 blockade with radiotherapy in metastatic melanoma or other tumors, with various treatment schedules either for ipilimumab (3 or 10 mg/kg) or radiotherapy (before or after ipilimumab, fractions of 6 to 8 Gy; total body irradiation or treatment of only one metastasis).\n\nOne study (NCT01565837) is a phase II study that analyses the efficacy of 10mg/kg ipilimumab (every 3 weeks) associated with HR for all metastatic sites but only for oligometastatic patients (\\< 6 metastasis), which reflects only a minority of metastatic melanoma patients.\n\nSuch strategy is of high interest because it takes into account the putative tumoral heterogeneity which could lead to failure of the association of nivolumab with the irradiation of only one tumor site.\n\nThe investigators propose to combine nivolumab with 3 fractions of HR of one metastasis for each tumor site (defined as skin/muscle, thoracic, abdomen, bone, other).They have chosen 3 fractions instead of only 1 for each tumor site because of preclinical data in mice showing that one fraction is less efficient than several fractions to stimulate the immune system and kill tumoral cells. The increase of the number of fractions could also lead to an increase of the diversity of tumoral antigens released in the blood stream which could also favors diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire of intratumoral T cells.\n\nIn our protocol dose constraint for each tissue type can be easily achieved with the 3 X 6 Gy schedule without excess of toxicity.\n\nIn conclusion the present protocol aims to increase the quantity and diversity of released tumoral antigens by providing multisite, multifractionated HR during nivolumab treatment in advanced untreated melanoma patients.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that combining nivolumab with multisite, multifractionated HR increases the overall survival rate at 1 year compared to published data with nivolumab alone."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Melanoma"], "keywords": ["advanced melanoma", "high dose radiotherapy", "Nivolumab"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 72, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Patient", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "patient with Advanced melanoma", "interventionNames": ["Biological: Nivolumab", "Radiation: hypofractionned radiotherapy"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "Nivolumab", "description": "Injection of nivolumab", "armGroupLabels": ["Patient"]}, {"type": "RADIATION", "name": "hypofractionned radiotherapy", "description": "radiation", "armGroupLabels": ["Patient"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "overall survival", "description": "to increase the overall survival rate at 1 year with the combination of nivolumab and radiotherapy compared to nivolumab alone for patients with advanced melanoma", "timeFrame": "1 year"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "the rate of progression-free survival", "timeFrame": "at 6 months"}, {"measure": "the rate of progression-free survival", "timeFrame": "at 1 year"}, {"measure": "the rate of progression-free survival", "timeFrame": "at 2 years"}, {"measure": "Global progression free survival (PFS) rate", "timeFrame": "at 6 months"}, {"measure": "Global progression free survival (PFS) rate", "timeFrame": "at 1 year"}, {"measure": "Global progression free survival (PFS) rate", "timeFrame": "at 2 years"}, {"measure": "global PFS rate", "timeFrame": "at 6 months"}, {"measure": "global PFS rate", "timeFrame": "at 1 year"}, {"measure": "global PFS rate", "timeFrame": "at 2 year"}, {"measure": "overall survival", "timeFrame": "at 2 years"}, {"measure": "disease control rate (DCR)", "timeFrame": "at 2 years"}, {"measure": "predictive factors for response", "timeFrame": "at 2 years"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Objective: To assess PA prevalence in a transversal cohort of patients with PTC and EH compared to a paired control group with HT.", "detailedDescription": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent cause of endocrine hypertension, with an estimated prevalence of 20% among individuals with resistant hypertension. PA is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, probably due to aldosterone effects in promoting cell proliferation. Recently, a high prevalence of PA was demonstrated in patients with essential hypertension (EH) and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), similarly to the prevalence of PA among individuals with resistant EH. In addition, abnormalities in thyroid ultrasound (non-toxic multinodular goiter) are more common in PA patients when compared to controls. Despite of this initial evidence, the link between PA and PTC remains to be elucidated. Then, the aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and genetic aspects of the association between PA and PTC. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate the prevalence of PA in a transversal cohort of patients with EH and PCT; 2) To investigate thyroid ultrasonography abnormalities in PA patients; 3) To perform exome sequencing (blood DNA) in patients with PA and PTC paired with tumor tissue; and 4) To conduct functional studies of the novel genetic variants identified by exome sequencing. To achieve this goal, the investigators will employ the following techniques: next-generation sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.

leakage of erythrocytes from small cerebral vessels, which can be detected noninvasively using susceptibility-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. CMBs are commonly observed in daily practice: their prevalence range from five percent in healthy individuals over 65 years old to 50% in patients with a history of stroke. CMBs are associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and also cognitive impairment and dementia.\n\nThe pathophysiology of CMBs is thought to primarily involve damage to brain microvasculature but the exact underlying cascade of events, including a potential role for haemostasis, has yet to be elucidated. Haemostatic defects (congenital or acquired) may contribute to an increased number and importance of CMBs. Congenital bleeding disorders such as haemophilia or von Willebrand disease (vWD), populations at high risk of ICH, are unique conditions that may give us further insights into a potential role of haemostatic defects in the pathophysiology of CMBs. CMBs might be the missing link between severe haemostatic defects, ICH risk and cognitive function.\n\nWe hypothesized that severe congenital haemostatic defects could contribute to an increased prevalence and number of CMBs, with an impact on cognition in adulthood."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cerebral Microbleeds, Congenital Haemophilia, Congenital Von Willebrand Disease"], "keywords": ["Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs)", "Congenital haemophilia", "Congenital von Willebrand disease (vWd)", "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD)", "Cognition", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "COHORT", "timePerspective": "CROSS_SECTIONAL"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 200, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "3-Tesla brain MRI and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment", "description": "Patients with a moderate to severe form of congenital haemophilia A or B or a severe form of von Willebrand disease will be consecutively recruited in the study during a routine follow-up visit at the Haemostasis and Transfusion Department of the Lille University Hospital."}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "The rate of patients with at least one CMB on 3-Tesla brain MRI (using specific sequences dedicated to the detection of CMBs).", "timeFrame": "Within 3 Months after inclusion"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number and anatomical location (deep/lobar) of CMBs on 3-Tesla brain MRI", "timeFrame": "Within 3 Months after inclusion"}, {"measure": "Multi-domain cognitive performances assessed by standardized scales as follows", "description": "\\- MoCA", "timeFrame": "Within 3 Months after inclusion"}, {"measure": "Multi-domain cognitive performances assessed by standardized scales as follows", "description": "Memory: The free and cued selective reminding test (FCSRT, French version) ;

Horse antithymocyte globulin is not available currently in Pakistan and response to Rabbit antithymocyte globulin is dismal as shown in number of international studies. So haploidentical stem cell transplant remains only curative option for patients lacking Matched sibling donor. Currently there are 2 major platforms used for haplo-identical stem cell transplant.

Unlike the patients presenting FA and suitable for medication and surveillance, the cases for which surgery is an indication are symptomatic (significant pain, discomfort, anxiety) and/or are presenting a growth observed during their surveillance with ultrasound examination. In addition, all the eligible patients will have to comply with the technical limitations of the HIFU method in terms of lump size, subcutaneous depth, presence of calcifications and other contraindications like presence of breast implants or under areolar location. Knowing that after the age of 45 years the lumps are in many institutions reserved exclusively for surgery in order to eliminate all suspicion of malignancy, the upper age limit is fixed at 45.

In most women, the disease is not diagnosed until advanced stage \\[1\\]. Moreover, the pelvis and ovaries in particular, are also a common place for secondary metastases. In 4% of ovarian masses, metastasis can be found from a tumour with another primary origin \\[2\\]. In primary ovarian cancer, patients may benefit from either primary debulking surgery or neoadjuvant therapy, depending on tumour staging and patients' comorbidities \\[5\\]. In recurrent disease treatment may include surgery, radiotherapy or systemic therapy, depending on primary tumour histology, extent of recurrence, previous treatment and disease-free interval \\[6-8\\]. In pelvic masses with ultrasound features suggesting metastatic disease, management will be guided by the origin of the primary tumour \\[9,10\\]. Therefore, histological diagnosis is important to select the optimal treatment strategy.\n\nTissue sampling by diagnostic laparoscopy or explorative laparotomy requires general anaesthesia and hospital admission, leading to higher costs and to potential surgical morbidity. Moreover, diagnostic laparoscopy is associated with a risk of port-site metastasis, ranging from 0.3-0.4% in endometrial and cervical cancer \\[11\\] and even 17-49% in advanced ovarian cancer \\[12,13\\].\n\nMinimally invasive procedures for diagnosis include fine-needle aspiration and tru-cut biopsy.\n\nAt fine-needle aspiration the quantity and integrity of the tissue is limited, enabling cytological evaluation only \\[14\\]. Tru-cut biopsy results in a higher specificity compared to fine needle biopsy and it enables histological examination including immunohistochemistry \\[15,16\\].\n\nA tru-cut biopsy can be performed under the guidance of different imaging modalities including ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, percutaneous CT-guided biopsies of deep pelvic masses are challenging because vital structures often obstruct the needle pathway \\[17\\].\n\nPrevious studies have investigated the use of ultrasound-guided biopsies for the assessment of abdominal and pelvic masses which showed a high diagnostic adequacy and minimal complication rate \\[4,16,18-25\\]. This can be done by percutaneous transabdominal approach , a transvaginal or transrectal approach.\n\nThe main goal of this prospective study is to evaluate the safety and tissue yield of ultrasound guided transvaginal or transrectal tru-cut biopsy in patients with pelvic tumors. Secondly, factors affecting the reliability of the biopsy-results will be analyzed, as well as patients' experience and pain. Finally, a comparison of biopsy results and final histological diagnosis will be performed in those patients undergoing surgical management.\n\n5\\. Study aims Primary Aim The main goal of our study is 1) to evaluate the safety (defined as absence of procedure-related complications) and 2) tissue yield (defined as sufficient amount of tissue for histological analysis) of ultrasound guided transvaginal or transrectal tru-cut biopsy in patients with pelvic masses.\n\nSecondary Aims\n\n* Analyzing factors affecting the safety and tissue yield. (The influence of selected variables such as number of biopsies per target lesion, length of the shot (15 vs 22 mm), thickness of needle (16-18 G), target lesion, target lesion size, histotypes etc. on these outcomes will be assessed.)\n* Assessment of patients' overall experience, assessment of pain and discomfort during the procedure and afterwards.\n* Comparison of biopsy result with final histological diagnosis: histological type (only in patients finally undergoing surgery)\n\nStudy design Prospective multicentric observational study"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Pelvic Cancer", "Ovarian Cancer", "Cervical Cancer", "Uterus Cancer", "Endometrial Cancer", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Ovarian Carcinoma", "Sarcoma Uterus", "Metastatic Cancer"], "keywords": ["Tru-cut", "Ultrasound", "Pelvic mass", "Ovarian cancer", "Gynaecologic oncology"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "COHORT", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 200, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Patient population", "description": "All consecutive patients (\\> 18 years) undergoing a tru-cut biopsy at the participating centers during the study periof will be eligible for inclusion in the study.\n\nAll biopsies will be performed by trained operators in gynecologic ultrasound and tru-cut biopsies.

{"briefSummary": "Little is known about the associated factors and mechanisms involved in the development of metabolic disturbance in pediatric obesity. The overall objective of the present study is to investigate clinical, anthropometric, socio-demographic and lifestyle predictors of MHO among obese children and adolescents. The Aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of fat distribution, muscle mass, strength and physical activity level on metabolic morbidity in obese adolescents.", "detailedDescription": "The global epidemic of childhood obesity and the accompanying rise in the prevalence of endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular comorbidities among the youth represents one of the most important public health issues of the modern world. The earlier occurrence and increase in the prevalence of both pediatric obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) lead to a potential decline in life expectancy such that the youth of today could be the first generation to live shorter lives than their parents.\n\nIn the context of the childhood obesity pandemic, a distinct subgroup of obese youth who are less prone to the development of metabolic disturbances, termed \"metabolically healthy obese\" (MHO), has recently been characterized. Despite their obese state, MHO individuals display a \"favorable\" metabolic profile, with preserved insulin sensitivity, normal BP and glucose regulation, normal lipid and liver enzyme levels, as well as a normal hormonal, inflammation and immune profile. Although the MHO status might not necessarily translate into lower mortality and can evolve into \"metabolically unhealthy obese\" (MUO) phenotype during puberty, defining the MHO subpopulation among obese youth is critically important in order to elucidate the mechanisms protecting against the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors, and their implications on clinical, preventive, and therapeutic decision-making.\n\nOnly few studies have evaluated predictors and risk factors for MUO, and they were based on a variety of definitions of MHO and the criteria used for defining it. Moreover, little is known about the mechanisms of the development of metabolic disturbances in pediatric obesity. More data are needed in order to identify the parameters most capable of predicting clinically significant outcomes. In this research, the researchers aim to investigate socio-demographic, clinical, anthropometric, physiological, and lifestyle predictors of MHO.\n\nAim:\n\n1. To investigate socio-demographic, clinical, anthropometric, and lifestyle predictors for MHO.\n2. To investigate the interaction between fat mass and distribution, muscle mass and strength and physical activity level on metabolic morbidity in obese adolescents.\n3. To investigate the association between MHO predictors and metabolic disturbances.\n\nStudy design:\n\n1\\. Patient Population This prospective observational, cross-sectional study will be performed in the Nutrition and Obesity Clinic of the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit at \"Dana Dwek\" Children's Hospital and at the \"Gepner Lab\" at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine.\n\nFifteen obese adolescents (age 12-18 years, body mass index \\[BMI\\] \\>95th percentile) without metabolic risk factors and fifteen obese adolescents (matched for BMI z-score, sex and age) with 1 or more components of the metabolic syndrome will be recruited.\n\nExclusion criteria: Adolescents with background diseases or past/current treatment with medications that may influence body composition or metabolic risk (e.g., inflammatory conditions).\n\n2 Data Collection\n\nThe information that will be obtained from the medical files will include:\n\n1. Sociodemographic characteristics: sex, ethnicity, home address, number of children in the family, household (single parent/two parent), parents' level of education.\n2. Medical history: perinatal characteristics (pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age, feeding practice during the first year of life), age of adiposity rebound, medications, menses (regular/irregular/oral contraceptives), sleep habits and family history of cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular episodes) in first- and second-degree relatives.\n3. The obese children's perceptions of their motivation, health and social status will be scored on a 1-10 scale and recorded at admission to the clinic.\n\nAll participants will undergo a clinical evaluation that includes a physical examination, systolic and diastolic BP and anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and calculated BMI).\n\nCLINICAL AND METABOLIC ASSESSMENT Weight and height will be measured according to standardized protocols. BMI percentiles will be computed by means of sex- and age- specific BMI reference values from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Body composition will be assessed with bioelectrical impedance. Laboratory and radiologic parameters will include a liver enzyme profile, a lipid profile, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and C-reactive protein levels, and abdominal ultrasonography. The participants will be referred for pelvic ultrasonography, polysomnography or an ophthalmologic evaluation if clinically indicated.\n\nNUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT The nutritional assessment will be based on an FFQ food report administered by a registered dietician at study entry.\n\nBODY COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT\n\n1. Lean body mass and fat mass will be calculated by bioelectrical impedance analysis by means of a multi-frequency SECA (mBCA 514 Medical) body composition analyzer. The participants will be required to wear light clothing during the body composition assessments and remove all jewelry, shoes, and socks. Measurements will be conducted in the morning following an overnight fast.\n2. Abdominal adipose tissue distribution and liver fat will be assessed by MRI and MRS.\n\n   Muscle function and physical activity Muscle strength and function will be measured by a handgrip dynanometer. The participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days in order to measure their levels of physical activity and sleep habits.\n3. Definition of Study Variables Ethnicity will be defined as the birthplace of the parents or grandparents (if the parents were born in Israel) and categorized according to country of origin. Socioeconomic position will be determined by the patient's home address according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics' Characterization and Classification of Statistical Areas within Municipalities and Local Councils by the Socio-Economic Level of the Population 2015"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Obesity", "Metabolic Syndrome"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "CASE_CONTROL", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "bioSpec": {"retention": "SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA", "description": "blood samples for metabolic syndrome, abdominal MRI for liver fat"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 60, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1", "description": "metabolic healthy obese", "interventionNames": ["Other: description"]}, {"label": "2", "description": "metabolic unhealthy obese", "interventionNames": ["Other: description"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "description", "description": "no intervention, just description of the groups", "armGroupLabels": ["1", "2"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Body composition (fat and fat free mass) of MHO", "description": "body fat and fat free mass of MHO will be assessed by bioelectrical impedance", "timeFrame": "1 day"}, {"measure": "Abdominal fat distribution using abdominal MRI", "description": "Abdominal fat distribution will be assessed by abdominal MRI. a researchers will calculate the visceral and sub-cutanic fat volume", "timeFrame": "3 days"}, {"measure": "Dietary pattern in MHO", "description": "Dietary pattern will be assessed by food frequency questioner that will asses consumption of dietary items (from once a day to less than once a month or never)", "timeFrame": "1 day"}, {"measure": "physical activity of MHO", "description": "physical activity be assessed by acetometer that will a measure walk distance per day", "timeFrame": "3 days"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Children aged 10-18 with obesity\n* Attendance of the obesity clinic in the pediatric gastroenterology unit at \"Dana-Dwek\" children's hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Children with congenital or acquired heart disease\n* Children with inflammatory conditions\n* Children with neurological conditions that affect body composition", "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "10 Years", "maximumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["CHILD", "ADULT"], "studyPopulation": "The study will be performed in the Nutrition and Obesity Clinic of the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit at \"Dana Dwek\" Children's Hospital.\n\nAll children and adolescents that will be admitted to our clinic between December 2020 and December 2024 will be included in the study.", "samplingMethod": "NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"centralContacts": [{"name": "Hadar Moran Lev, MD", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "972527360713", "email": "hadarlev6@gmail.com"}], "locations": [{"facility": "Tel Aviv medical center", "status": "RECRUITING", "city": "Tel Aviv", "country": "Israel", "contacts": [{"name": "Hadar Moran Lev, MD", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "972527360713"}], "geoPoint": {"lat": 32.08088, "lon": 34.78057}}]}, "referencesModule": {"references": [{"pmid": "40704318", "type": "DERIVED", "citation": "Moran-Lev H, Sternfeld R, Lazmi R, Ohayon R, Dudi R, Brener A, Sagi SZ, Cohen S, Lubetzky R, Gepner Y.

People with CKD often do not have associated symptoms, meaning that it is possible for the condition to go undetected until the condition worsens and symptoms develop. The disease is more common in people with diabetes and screening by means of urine and blood tests is recommended in this population by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines in order to detect disease earlier. However, screening rates amongst these patients are low and the dilemma is therefore how to increase the rate of screening in those who are ordinarily non-compliant. It is thought that facilitating patients in being able to perform The Minuteful Kidney Test (an at home test using smartphone technology) may increase the amount of people that undertake the test and thus improving early detection. 348 GP practices will be randomised in clusters, meaning that the GP practice will be randomised rather than the individual patient. This type of trial design is common in public health research as it is particularly suited to testing differences in approaches towards patient care. Each cluster will consist of on average 470 patients with diabetes. Each cluster will be allocated at random to either issuing The Minuteful Kidney Test (plus usual care) or usual care alone. This allocation will be applicable to each patient within that cluster. The evaluation will tell us whether administering this test increases the diagnosis rates of CKD as well as the frequency at which the test is performed in patients with diabetes. The results of the evaluation will determine whether The Minuteful Kidney Test should be used instead of or alongside existing blood and urine tests in this particular group of patients.", "detailedDescription": "The National CKD Audit (2017) (1) identified that 11 million people in the UK are at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a long-term irreversible deterioration in kidney function with occurrence being more common in those with diabetes. NICE CG182 and NICE QS05 define testing Albumin:Creatinine ratio (ACR) in at risk populations as critical from a clinical and cost point of view. Despite its importance in the prevention of kidney disease, ACR testing is the worst performing of all 9 NICE diabetes care processes with low screening rates among patients, making this a critical area for improvement. Home testing strategies may therefore be useful in improving proteinuria screening adherence, which the National CKD Audit (2017) (1) finding that up to 65% of people with diabetes have relevant annual urinary ACR tests.\n\nThe overarching aim of The Minuteful Kidney Test Evaluation\n\n* https://healthy.io/services/kidney\n* https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/understand-ai/healthyio-smartphone-albuminuria-urine-self-testing/ is to increase the use of ACR testing to identify previously undiagnosed albuminuria in those with diabetes. The primary hypothesis is that there will be an increase in proportion of individuals screened in general practices utilising the Minuteful Kidney Test (plus usual care) compared with general practices delivering usual care alone; and that this will result in a higher proportion of previously undiagnosed CKD being diagnosed in individuals in the intervention practices. The suitability of the technology for widescale deployment will also be addressed by exploring differences in outcomes by baseline characteristics alongside the qualitative process evaluation which will also gain an understanding of the technology's application across the UK population through a mixed method evaluation.\n\nUsing a Cluster RCT design, randomisation will operate on a 1:1 basis with a 50% chance of a cluster being allocated to the intervention. 348 practices (clusters) are required, with one cluster added to each arm to account for any whole cluster drop out. The average cluster size will consist of 470 patients with DM, determined as constant by how many patients with DM are eligible for annual review. 348 GP practices would provide 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect an increase in rate of CKD from 3% in the control arm to 4.3% in the intervention arm. This would provide over 90% power at the 5% significance level to detect an absolute increase of 7% in ACR test rate in the intervention arm compared to control (65% to 72%). The calculations assumed an ICC of 0.05, a coefficient of variation to allow for variation in in cluster size of 0.128 (cluster size range of 360-600)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Diabetes", "Chronic Kidney Diseases"], "keywords": ["Diabetes"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "CASE_CONTROL", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 163560, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention:", "description": "Offered the Minuteful Kidney Test Kit", "interventionNames": ["Diagnostic Test: Minuteful Kidney Test Kit"]}, {"label": "Control", "description": "Continue as standard of care"}], "interventions": [{"type": "DIAGNOSTIC_TEST", "name": "Minuteful Kidney Test Kit", "description": "The Minuteful Kidney Test is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based innovative technology to enable people at risk of CKD to undertake an ACR test at home using smartphone technology", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention:"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Proportion of patients with a diagnosis of CKD", "timeFrame": "At 6 months follow up extraction"}, {"measure": "Proportion of patients with ACR test in the last 12 months", "timeFrame": "At 6 months follow up extraction (12 months preceding)"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Proportion of patients with newly diagnosed CKD (i.e., since randomisation)", "timeFrame": "Between baseline and 6 months data extraction"}, {"measure": "Proportion of patients with albuminuria", "timeFrame": "At 6 months follow up extraction"}, {"measure": "Proportion of patients with newly diagnosed albuminuria (i.e., since randomisation)", "timeFrame": "Between baseline and 6 months data extraction"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "GP Practice Eligibility Criteria:\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\n1.

In particular, complex patients (defined as those patients who do not respond to current disease management approaches) with multiple concurrent chronic conditions represent a key segment of the population that would benefit from new approaches to care. In response to PA-12-024: Behavioral Interventions to Address Multiple Chronic Conditions in Primary Care, which seeks \"practical interventions\u2026to modify behaviors using a common approach\" among patients with multiple co-morbidities, the investigators are testing an integrated behavioral intervention designed to improve a core set of chronic disease self-management skills and to overcome common barriers to care engagement encountered by this increasingly important segment of the U.S. adult primary care population. This randomized trial will be conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated care delivery system serving over 3.2 million members, including patients insured through Medicare and state Medicaid programs. The investigators will evaluate the intervention in 3 KPNC primary care practices by enrolling 576 complex patients who have persistently (\u2265 2 years) uncontrolled CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) despite being enrolled in a CVD disease management program. This behavioral intervention is designed to activate and engage patients, identify potentially hidden barriers to care such as alcohol misuse or sub-clinical depression, and to develop individualized care plans that are designed to catalyze more effective primary care management. Randomization will be at the patient-level. The investigators will examine the impact of the intervention on clinical outcomes (control of systolic blood pressure, HbA1c (if with diabetes), statin treatment rates) after 12 months and patient-reported outcomes (patient activation, medication adherence, and mental health status) after 6 months.
